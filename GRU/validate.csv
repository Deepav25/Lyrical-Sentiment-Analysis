"Something beautiful
Happens this time of the year
Unbelievable
Knowing that Christmas will soon be here

Making an angel on new fallen snow
Take an icicle souvenir
It's so beautiful
You just gotta love Christmas

Something magical
Happens this time every night
So incredible, candles and ribbons
And so many colored lights

Gather the family and sit by the fire
Sing when the gang's all here
It's so magical
You just gotta love Christmas

Little children find it hard to sleep at right
Waiting for old Santa and his reindeer
A time to see each other in a different light
There are so many reasons
You just gotta love Christmas

Little children find it hard to sleep at night
Waiting for old Santa till the morning light
It's a time to see each other in a different way
It's a wonderful time of the year
You just gotta love Christmas

Gotta love Christmas
Gotta love Christmas
Gotta love Christmas",7
"Right before my very eyes
I thought that you were only fakin' it
And like before my heart was takin' it 

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes 

Yesterday it seemed to me
My life was nothing more than wasted time
But here today you've softly changed my mind 

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Baby what a big surprise 

Just to be alone
Was a little more than I could take
Then you came to stay
Hold me in the morning
Love me in the afternoon
Help me find my way 

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Baby what a big surprise 

Baby what a big surprise
Right before my very eyes
Baby what a big surprise",6
"No one can buy tomorrow
No one can sell their sorrow
But when you look into my eyes
Darling, you'll always see

Love, I will give you love
Come live your life with me

We'll have our good times and even in sad times
With love we will find the way
Nothing else matters but loving each other
The way that we do today

Here in our world together
Love will go on forever
Warm in the shelter of my arms
Darling, you'll always be

Love, I will give you love
Come live your life with me

Here in our world together
Love will go on forever
Warm in the shelter of my arms
Darling, you'll always be

Love, I will give you love
Come live your life with me

"The question that I pose is really easy
It came to me the moment you walked by
It seem to me you looked at me so sweetly
The moment that I stared into your eyes

Are you the one to steal my heart completely?
Are you the one that I am to adore?
Are we the pair that slips away discretely?
Are you the one that I have waited for?

We can toast the moon sitting by a fire
And then walk hand in hand for others to admire

Are you the one to paint the town so brightly?
Are you the one I simply can't ignore?
Are we the pair that dance together nightly?
Are you the one that I have waited for?

We can sail the seas on an ocean liner and then drink pink champagne
Our life could be no finer

Are you the one to paint the town so brightly?
Are you the one I simply can't ignore?
Are we the pair that dance together nightly?
Are you the one that I have waited for?

Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Are you the one?
Oh are you the one?

"Comes a rainstorm, put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm, you can get a little heat
Comes love, nothing can be done

Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
Blow a tire, you can buy another shoe
Comes love, nothing can be done

Don't try hiding, it isn't any use
You'll start sliding when your heart turns on the juice

Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done

That's all brother, if you've ever been in love
That's all brother, you know just what I'm speakin' of

Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you can get another break
Comes love, nothing can be done",7
"Don't keep on asking where I've been
I'm not some guy you discipline
Stop that crying
No use justifying
Baby, I changed the rules.
Don't keep me waiting at the door
I'm not some cat that you ignore
Keep on whining, and I'll keep on declining
Baby, I changed the rules.
You can't stop me from shooting the breeze
I always say and do as I please
But don't stop trying
You know I'm gratifying
Keep the pace
You're in the race
You feel the heat right by my side
Stay close, I'll take you for a ride
Stimulating
Really intoxicating
Baby, I changed the rules
You can't stop me from shooting the breeze
I always say and do as I please
But don't stop trying
You know I'm gratifying
Keep the pace
You're in the race
You feel the heat right by my side
Stay close, I'll take you for a ride
Stimulating
Really intoxicating
Baby, I changed the rules
I changed the rules

"I raise my glass to our happy ending
I sip my wine to our grand demise
This game we played is finally over
Lovers, secrets, lies...

And now at last the spell is broken
The truth can now be spoken
Heartache is just a token
Lovers, secrets, lies...

No lonely night to wait and wonder, no secret sites for a rendezvous
My empty heart is well protected
Lovers, secrets, lies...

Forget the pain, forget the earning
My life is now returning
My heart's no longer burning
Lovers, secrets, lies...",5
"Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing
And what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
All of us under its spell. We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that called the young sailors
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me",6
"What goes up must come down
Spinning Wheel got to go 'round
Talkin' 'bout your troubles
It's a cryin' sin
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel spin
You got no money, you got no home
Spinning Wheel all alone
Talkin' 'bout your troubles and you
You never learn
Ride a painted pony
Let the Spinning Wheel turn
Did you find your directing sign 
On the straight and narrow highway
Would you mind a reflecting sign?
Just let it shine within your mind
And show you the colors that are real
Someone is waiting just for you
Spinning Wheel spinning true
Drop all you troubles by the river side",5
"When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like the lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance, you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I grow weak

I can hear the sound of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Sway me now

You know it ain't right to treat me like you do
When you don't want me to, do these things to you
You know it ain't right to treat me this-a way

Takes my money, and go off to play
You know it ain't right to say what you did
You know it ain't right to say what you did
You've got another man, and you can't keep it hid
You know it ain't right to stay out all night long
You know it ain't right to stay out all night long
I ain't got nobody, to carry my business on

"I feel so doggone lonely
Today just isn't my day
When I got home this mornin'
I found a letter on my bed

When I opened up that latter
I broke right down and cried
She said, 'Now, daddy I hate to leave you
Oh, yes but I'm in love with another guy'

Oh no, I couldn't believe
I couldn't believe she wrote it
So, I read it over again
An' when I was finished
A-tears stream down like rain 

The more I read this doggone letter
The more my poor heart cried
She said, 'Now, daddy I hate to leave you
Oh yeah, but I'm in love with another guy'

My baby, she said, 'Oh yeah'
My baby, she said

My baby, she said 

My baby, she said

This what she said
'Now, daddy I hate to leave you
Oh, but I'm in love with another guy'.",5
"I need someone's hand, to lead me through the night
I need someone arms to hold and squeeze me tight
When the night begins an' the dew remains
I need your love so bad
I need some lips to feel next to mine
I need someone to stand up an' tell me, when I'm lyin'
When the lights are low, an' it's time to go
I need your love so bad

So give it up an' bring it home to me
Or write it on a paper, so it can be read to me
Tell me you love me an' stop drivin' me mad
'Cause I need your love so bad

I need a soft voice that will talk to me at night
Don't worry baby, we won't fuss an' fight
Listen to my plea, bring it home to me

"Somewhere, somehow
Sometime, some place
I did someone wrong
And now I'm suffering with the blues

Don't know just where 
Or why, or how
I must have been wrong
'Cause now I'm suffering with the blues

Why does your love taunt me
Haunt me through the night?
When I know that you don't, oh want me
If you did you'd be here by my side

Somewhere, somehow
I must have hurt you deep down inside
Or why else would I be here
Suffering with the blues?

Oh-oh, why else would I be here
Suffering with the blues?",4

That we were through
And all the time, I thought
That your love was true

You me, you hurt me so
You know you hurt me
When you let me go

You always told me
We'd never, ever part
But now you turn around
And break my loving heart

I'm begging, please come back to me!
A life is now at stake
And if you don't soon return
You're gonna drive me to my grave

If you don't soon return

To my nerves, oh, my nerves 
Oh, my nerves

You hold me tight and kiss me right
My nerves, oh, my nerves
I get such a thrill, it sends a chill
To my nerves, all my nerves

A-can't you see what you do to me
To have me feel this way?
I pat my feet, and I clap my hands
And I snap my fingers all day

Whisper low that you love me so
My nerves, all my nerves
I should be bold when I lose control
Of my nerves, all my nerves

Like the sun shines in the summer
Like the sun shines in the fall
I'll be there anytime you want me
All you gotta do is call 

Call my name and you start that flame
In my nerves, all my nerves
When you're around, I can't hold 'em down
My nerves, all my nerves

One little squeeze, and I just kinda ease
My nerves, whoa, my nerves!
I'm a total wreck 'cause I just can't check
My nerves

Whoa!

"Our little dream castle with every dream gone,
Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon
A cottage for sale

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,
But when I reach a window, there's empty space.
The key's in the mail box the same as before,
But no one is waiting any more,
The end of the story is told on the door.

The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do

And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you

"Boom 
My voice says make room
May the hand combat the gloom
When the ant comes creeping up
I spread my arms so I'd assume
My vest starts to bloom
With the breath that I consume
And I grow like grass on the hillside
It's the way I leave my tomb
Was it dark in there at all?
It was dark I must admit
Was it you that I heard call?
It was me from yonder pit
Was it what you thought was you?
It was me and someone else
I was crying out for you
In high and girly swell
Is the gleam you thought was gone
Beginning to return?
When you lay down on the lawn
Can't you feel its fiery burn
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the dooby doo
Boom
My voice says make room
May the hand combat the gloom
When the dark slips in 
I spread my arms so why did I consume
The depth of its doom
With the brightness I resume
And I grow green leaves on my branches 
Its the way my blossoms bloom
Wasn't I the wind that blew?
Here is that what you allowed
To come wildly rushing through
You became a gambit howl
Was it finally coming true
It had never ceased to be
Wasn't I the light that grew
Wasn't that light born in me
Here is that what you have touched
When you weren't trying to
It was how you made so much
By forgetting what was you
See the rooftops in the sun
See the fading afternoon
Feel the tangle come undone
Hear the dooby doo
And like a mountain peak so high and stout
I blew my little bloomy guts about
I was told I've always been
With flashing flood and whipping wind
I live with everything that I can't do without",5
"Hear it like a pounce upon a pickle
Look at what the light did now
Bear it like a bounce upon the beagle
Look at what the light did now

Land and water and bird or beast, oh
Look at what the light did now
Shiny little band or golden fleece, oh
Look at what the light did now

Look at what the light did now 

Look at what the light did now 

Look at what the light did now 

In my will I went 'till it's wasted
Look at what the light did now
Taste the taste I taste 'till it's tasted
Look at what the light did now

Bought it like a boast that burly beaming
Look at what the light did now
Got it like a ghost that girly gleaming
Look at what the light did now

Look at what the light did now 

Look at what the light did now 

Look at what the light did now

Like a dead tree that's dry and leaving
Look at what the light did now
Play it on me with grief and grieving
Look at what the light did now

I would finally fall to pieces
Look at what the light did now
We'll meet soon as nephew's nieces
Look at what the light did now

Look at what the light did now 

Look at what the light did now 

Look at what the light did now",6
"This is a note, to self situation
A microphone test or a dense dictation
Last time, they tried to fit me in a funny suit
This time, they tried to fill my pocket full of loot

Next time, they'll start to weep while I'm bailing
Next time, I'll have to wait through their wailing
Last time, they had to hang me like a poster
This time, they rode me like a rollercoaster,

Next time, they'll have to find if they wanna try
Next time, they'll have a long time to wonder why
I always turn my head when they walk by
I make believe my shoelace came untied

Better yet act like something's in my eye
Oh I gotta do what I don't want to
High as the heaps that hunt and haunt you
Pouring to paint your peeling won't you

Pull a pal away when he's reeling don't you
Look at last time for one minute
I'll promise I'll try
Look at this time will and win it

With a gleaming in my eye
Look at next time search and squint it
Pull power from the sky
Look at what the light does when we're in it

So I wonder why, I stop to wonder why
Last time, they spread me shallow like the gravel
This time, they struck me twice like a gavel
Order in the court!

What court? is the question
Give no retort, leave everybody guessing
Last time, they bent me over like a rainbow
This time, they step through me like a tango

Next time, I'll abbreviate it so they won't lose their breath every time they say it
Oh I'll keep a song inside their head and bloom
Feed it sweet light, fertilize it with some tune
If words are the wrist then music's the perfume

Oh song from the mouth of friend or stranger
Dangerous bird or bird of danger
If you can keep up, well why won't you?
Songs everywhere, so I sing it, don't you?

Look at last time for one minute
I'll promise I'll try
Look at this time will and win it
With a gleaming in my eye

Look at next time search and squint it
Pull power from the sky
Look at what the light does when we're in it
Now I wonder why, I stop to wonder why

Last time, last time
This time, this time
Next time, next time

"Then, (Ida?) break the spell of change,
And so to duly rearrange,
The faces that you've seen before.
And, let the will of absence pour.

The gravity will keep you near,
Inside its arms that are so clear that
You may never even see them, but
Realize everything could be them.

Up and down your chest will rise.
There's no invisible disguise.
Your face is open sky sometimes.
Your chest a forest grown inside.

Feed it, let it grow, and replicate.
The universe, you know it has no weight.
It waits for magnets, waits for gravity.
So I know everything I have was sent for me.

Unwrap it all and skin me.
Climb on all the branches in me.
Look through light and see me in it.
Name the game so we can win it.

And, everything, oh everything,
In your cloaks you go,
Disguising what you work through,
Talking to me as I go.

And, become my life, become my time.
Become that year that's never mine.
Let that come through, let glory shine.
Grow up and feel the change inside.

Expand, expand like land horizon.
Sponge and water soak the skies.
Intake through what brought you by breathing
Life into the life you're leading.

First came dust and light,
So it's late at night,
And I can see the first thing in your
Headlights while we drive.

And we pull over.
I am sober.
My face looks older.
You touch my shoulder.

Now you've seen me.
Now I've seen you.
Now we try somehow to share the time
That we've been through.

And, I could feel the brains were born anew,
Anew by light of morning, walking
In the skin that grew.
It grew me and I grew it too.

It knew me and I knew it too.
And no one feels the day go through
Exactly in the way I do.
That's what makes me, me, and you, you.

And I can be what makes me.
And you won't be what breaks me.
And I can wait for all that wakes me,
In the way I've always done.

I'm finding out what chose me,
How to use the hand that rose me,
How to sing the word that woes me.
In a way I've just begun.

In a way I've just begun unravelling
This costume at the seams that I design.
I know it inside out.
I know that you attend may bring.

But whenever I am here,
I am aware of everything.

I'm something I can understand.
I am the sky, I am the land.
I am the foot, I am the hand.
I am the wave headed for sand.
I am the cattle and the brand.
I am the souvenir stand.
I am the hometown, local band.
I am the mic, I am the stand,
I'm everybody.",6

Like a fireball in your palm?

And all the places I've been

Just to take a little moment
To see what's mine and yours?

I'm falling, hope you hear my call
I put proposals on the wall
Have you missed them all?

But I still feel hope when I hear your name
They're about to let you run up
Before I even hear you coming

When I felt those lips only I can taste
They're about to let you run it

For a time, I tried to pass the blame

But I'm asking you to play me anyway

I'm putting my faith in you
To put one foot down in front of the other one
Faith in you
To bring us back from wherever we've gone
Leave it up to you, babe, to fix the mess I've made
We'll take us back to somewhere good
Where our love was better
We can be alone together

"Deus ex machina...
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was hardly nothing left
But a bare and sore ground
Lite a stripped and dried out soul
Without body and skin
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
Reminding them of how old they are
Suddenly a force from above
Silenced the elegy
It was at the end of the day
It was at the end of the day
Although the beginning of a new and bright tomorrow
Deus ex machina...
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was a last sudden gust of wind
Before the life and freshness again
Touched every heart, mind and soul
And the comfortable summer breeze
Played with the green leaves of the hazel trees
Reminding them of how young
And beautiful they are
Echoing a sorrowless future to come
They thought about their lives
How satisfying they were
And they spoke with happy childlike voices
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
Deus ex machina...

"She's the month of June
A summer's tune
The wind that blows
The flower that grows
She'll forever be
So proud and free
A firefly
The sun in the sky
And forever she'll dance
It's the summer
Of her days and forever
Her heart is yours
In the heart of Juliet
One love she won't forget
She longs to give
Forever live
Her soul has such desire
She needs to love, admire
A tide to the shore
Searching for more
No vale of tears
No hauting fears
Another birth
She's joy on earth
Dancing like a child
So pure and wild
A virgin rose
She longs to be close

"Watching the tidals that wash to the shore - I never forget
Into these silent waves of all times - eternally
How long may this remain
Peace to the land
Nature and sea
Silent emotions are overcome
I wonder how
We can go on
Stormy times will we behold ?
Do we still care
What future holds
So many words been said undone
The waves of green
They will flow on
Heal me, free me - dawning is near
Where is the saviour - for us to believe
As I sit here - on Norge's shores
Cries of the unheard - will they be heard
The waves of green - whispering my name

"I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realize he's there
When I turn the light off and turn over
Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some horizon

But suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love 'til eternity

Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes

He's so very understanding
And he's so aware of all my situations
And when I stay up late
He's always waiting but I feel him hesitate

Oh, I'm so worried about my man
They say, no, no, no, no, no, it won't last forever
But here I am again, my girl
Wondering what I'm doing here
Maybe he doesn't really love me
I just took a trip

Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes

I can hear him knocking
(Ooh, he's here again)
I can hear him knocking
(Man with a child in his eyes)
Oh, he's knocking at my front door

And he's breaking my heart
(Ooh, he's here again)

But I love him, yes, I do

(Ooh, he's here again)
Just a man, just a man

He's trying to do the best he can

(Ooh, he's here again)
I can hear him knocking

Like a come that comes and goes
With a sweetness in her eyes
And a ring between her nose

Walking down the beach
We saw a castle made of pain
We went inside
Rings were exchanged
And heaven wore a shirt

That said
I really, really, really love you
I really, really, really love you

Suddenly it came
Into my mind not preconceived
A dream of many oceans
And not the god that i believed

But like the come that came and went
My mind just had to intercede
The need for repetition arose
Now heaven wears a shirt

That says

If this is peace then I

Let's look together
And find out what love is not

I've been to every book
I've been to every seer
In order to find the truth
As if it lives somewhere

I want to uproot my violence
I want to live like a saint
I want to give up everything

Just like the businessman wants to gain
Just like the businessman wants to gain

Please don't tell me what peace is
Let's look together
And find out what love is not",6

Will you run and tell the neighbors 
Will you hide behind that get up that you wear 
Or will take the first ear that comes into contact with you blade 
Like peter did on the hill 
Will you call her a freak? 
Will you call them freaks? 
If the mother goes to bed with you 
Will you run and tell the papers 
How she picked you from a line up in downtown Philadelphia 
With a cigarette hangin' out of your mouth and Henry Miller in your 
Back pocket 
You little fucker 
If the mother goes to bed with you 
In the bowels of the cathedral 
Will you render her asunder with what she really needs 
Or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about 
Finding yourself in your mother's arms 
Will you call her a freak 
Will you call them freaks 
Or will you call the gods 
Will you call them freaks 
You know your sperm is weak 
You never looked, so high 
To ever find her, so low 
You did not have to go, that far 
To show her that you were holy 
Now you know they're gonna come for you 
And drag your silly name into the mud 
If the mother bears your children without tears 
And the usual cost of labor",5
"Then you were dead 
Subsistin' on that same old bread

The whole wide world

It's the memory that hides 
Take your photographs back 
For the love of all gods 

Our gas he'd marches on 
Our gas he'd marches on 
He's a bonified man 
A star amongst his clan 

And the only one that let me ride 
It's the memory that dies 
Our gas he'd was right 
When they lanced his skull 

There was puss and light 
It's the memory that dies 
So take your photographs back 
For the love of all gods 

Our gas he'd marches on 
Our gas he'd marches 
It's the memory that dies 
And make your photographs black 

For the love of all gods

of the demons driven out
and happily replaced
with the presence of real love

Heard a lot of talk about the sea

Heard a lot of talk about my spirit

A man of love, and a man of strength
But what a man was two thousand years ago
means nothing at all to me today

To the left of your body
To the right of your mind
Lost in a riddle I was helpless to understand
I went to a healer
The healer held my hand
She said: ""All of these things
Are written the sand behind me""

Oh, I dream about you every night
I call your name
The whole world thinks that I am insane
Here I come again

I caught a glimpse of Heaven last night
Through a crack in the mirror
That fractalized the light
A saint is a sinner
A sinner is a saint
It's all just the cloaks we hide behind
A cartoon in the brain
And I say: ""All of these things
Are written in the sand behind me""

Oh, I dream about you every night
I call your name
The whole world thinks that I am insane
Here I come again

Oh, well I am the hero of love
Taking you higher
I want to be your hero of love
Is it getting better, is it getting brighter
I want to be your hero
Your hero of love

I caught a glimpse of Heaven last night
Was that a number ninety-six
Or was it a sixty-nine
Oh, I was lost in a riddle I was helpless to understand
I went to a lover
This lover held my hand
She said: ""All of these things
Are just written in the sand behind me""

I will come back again
To destroy everything you stood for

Oh yeah,
I will go on, like a soldier
Through the storms of love

And everything was glowin' like some tree in the bush

With some pretty scary brethren

To the crib and back to the studio
To write a song so good, make a midget grow
From the North pole down to Mexico

Pouring down from above

Like so much rain it fell
And pierced my brains 
The trees all-alive with their colors

Search of better days 
But paradise took you out and left the bill

You were the healer without the thrill
You were the ecstasy without the pill

Oh 
Who's gonna save your soul
Who's gonna make your heart beat again

Who's gonna light up your dark
Who's gonna save your soul
Who's gonna be there
Who's gonna light up your dark

And from a tiny river town you came
With momma's rockstar dreams in tow
And daddy's brains
You better turn back before the frost sets in
These desert nights are for weathered men
The ones who've already given in

Oh 
Who's gonna save your soul
Who's gonna make your heart beat again
Who's gonna save your soul

Now that you've given in",5
"""Looks like I've lost my will to carry on, my friend"" she said
And you can hear it in my whispered cries for love
I need your blissful touch to carry me away again
So can we roll tonight, roll through your desert, can we start over and just

Run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory, but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right
We can just run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right

""Looks like I've lost my will to carry on, my friend"" she said
I'm like a posse that's been ridin' for days
I've got the scars to prove that love has had its day and it's way with me
So can we roll tonight, roll through your desert, can we start over and just

Run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right
We can just run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right

This ain't no night to be on your own
You've got to know where you're coming from
To know just where you're goin', lord
You've got to know where you're coming from
This ain't no night to be on your own

Run away, run away tonight
It ain't no victory but I don't care, I don't care if its wrong or right

I don't care I don't care I don't care I don't care

"Paint a moustache on the Mona Lisa
Ride a Harley through the heart of danger
Pick up a pen and fight a war for the right to dream
I was seventeen

Give up my house, sleep for nights on concrete
Meditate with all the bums on Vine Street
No more running, no more hiding in the house of the dead
I think I'll grow some dreads

I believe in the sanctity of dreams
No more running from these masqueraders
I believe that society will never dream like me

I dream of loving, of the empty graveyard
I dream of Vegas and the transcendental wildcard
A place where no one waits to die before they go into the light
And just the blind have sight

I follow nothing but the compass of my instinct
No matter where it leads, I know it will take me to the brink
And leave me there by myself and all alone with my dreams
Can you hear my scream?

I believe in the sanctity of dreams
No more running from these masqueraders
I believe that society will never dream like me
Never dream like me
Society will never dream like me
Never dream like me
Ooh ooh ooh
I believe in the sanctity of dreams
No more running from these masqueraders
I believe that society will never dream like me
Oh-oh

I believe that society will never dream like me

Now every word that she speaks to me is pure gold
She set my soul free
She give me love, give me hope, give me strength to bear my faults for you

Was my intention to take control again?
Somehow you got me on the ropes of my own plan
To turn up the volume and make you dance for me
Release some pressure so that I can turn and see
Spirit manifests as 'She'

She lived in the land of never-never
Where everything real is unreal
And only fairy tales come true
Something like me and you

But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real
So she strived on to make it come true
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her
Never giving up the hope within her

She carried on and on, because she believed
That once, once in a time in her lifetime
The things so unreal would be real

And in the morning, one day when she awoke
To find herself surrounded by the same old room
She was disappointed

So she dreamed and she dreamed
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed
And she said that fairy tales do come true
'Cause I believe, I believe

And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting
Till one day she met a man who held her tight
And she fell in love

Once upon a time, in the land of never-never
Where all things real are unreal
There lived a girl who believed
That all things could be possible

And one day she did awake
And found herself somewhere else
Beside her a brand new face
Of someone that she loved",6

Goodbye Marie - oh goodbye Marie
Out the window there's a lonesome highway callin' me
It was fun Marie - I gotta run Marie
If I cannot keep your love
At least I'll have your memory

Por favor pour me One more tequila
I need all the courage I can find

This time tomorrow I'll be back in Houston
Thinkin' about the girl I left behind

As I'm hearing all the words you say

There is more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know
It's more than we've dreamed
More than we've seen or heard of before
There is more

Instead of dreaming
You're trying to keep yourself alive
And make it through another day

Though it's not easy
Believe me there's a reason why
He gave His life so you can live yours
That's what He came here for

To give us more love than we can imagine
There is more grace than we'll ever know

More hope than ever thought possible

And bits of aspiration lying in the sand
The stained glass wall of love that I cannot see through
Provides the only light  here in my lonely room

A breeze reminds me of the changing time and place
A tear that takes forever rolls down your timeless face

I hear that they say that broken hearts will mend
But when they do they're never good as new
I wish right now I could change it back
I never meant to do the things I did to hurt you

I never really thought that it would come to this
Sometimes the things you lose are often the things you miss
I see the reason for things I used to do
They're all transparent now and so I see the truth
I hear they say that broken hearts will men
But when they do they're never good as new
I wish right now that I could change it back

Gonna make you love me baby

Other people they can split
I can never stop
I can never quit

Take a walk through the land of the shadows
Take a walk through the peaceful meadows
Don't look so disappointed
Isn't what you hoped for is it?

There's a party in my mind
And I hope it never stops
I'm stuck here in this seat
And I may not stand up

Other people can go home
Other people they can split

Everyone's gone to sleep
I'm wide awake

Elvis seen at a shopping mall

Picture a zombie Elvis
In a tacky white jump suit
Just imagine a rotting Elvis
Shopping for fresh fruit

Elvis is dead
Elvis is dead
Elvis is dead
Elvis is dead
Elvis is dead
Elvis is dead
Elvis is dead

When the king died
He was all alone
I heard that when he died
He was sitting on his throne

Alas poor Elvis
They made us know you well
Now you dwell forever
In the Heartbreak Hotel

Elvis was a hero to most
But that's beside the point
A Black man taught him how to sing
And then he was crowned king

The pelvis of Elvis
Too dangerous for the masses

They cleaned him up and sent him to Vegas
Now the masses are his slave
Slave? Slave
Yes, even from the grave

Elvis is dead

Back to the beginning

They can hurt me, jail my body
I'll still be free
I've got the solace of you

They can take my land
Tell me I'm not who I am
I've got the solace of you

A wise man said to know thyself

Just the solace of you

"Touch without seeing love with no feeling
Stealing a moment, under cover of darkness

I'd like to kiss you let my lips caress you
Sending sparks of passion up your spine
But doing so means saying no and even
The thought would be a crime

I like to touch your skin even if it is a sin
I'd rather burn than not touch you
I might just go mad thinking what I might have had
And all the things I'd like to do

[Chorus]
Safe seduction isn't what it is
Sexuality isn't what it appears to be
It's what you think you see

I want to make you hot
Touch that spot and send you on a trip
But my consequence is abstinence
And Lord knows I just can't slip
I want to feel you/the real you
Not the projection that you let me see
The safest sex is when it's not skin to skin
It's very simple let your mind go free

[Chorus]

To do or not to do that is the question
Over and over you're prone to suggestion
And I simply can't condone the fact
That you want to make your bed my home
Let's say I take this man as my lover
And he swears that there will never be another
But really he doesn't give a damn about safe sex
And with all these other girls he has a taste test
Well the thrill doesn't outweigh the consequences
Therefore I am using my common senses
To let you know I adore you
But I'm afraid I'm not the one for you

You need friends, you need help

"The glamour boys swear they are a diva
The glamour boys have it all under control
Always dancing and always laughing
The glamour boys are playing the role

The glamour boys never have no money
The glamour boys wear the most expensive clothes
The glamour boys are always at the party
Where the money comes from heaven only knows

I ain't no glamour boy - I'M FIERCE
I ain't no glamour boy - (snap)
I ain't no glamour boy - I'M FIERCE
I ain't no glamour boy

The glamour boys live off their ambition
The glamour boys have it all figured out
A very, very dubious position
When you got no clout

The glamour boys whole life is a gamble
They might get over or fall flat on their face
But if one does, there's no need to worry
Another G-Boy will take this place

I ain't no glamour boy - I'M FIERCE

The glamour boys don't think tomorrow
The glamour boys just need tonight to play
But just like things you can't afford on credit
Time catches up and you have to pay

The glamour boys are always on the guest list
You'll always find them in the hottest spots in town
They'll be your friend if you have fame or fortune
If you don't they won't be hanging 'round

I ain't no glamour boy - I'M FIERCE",5

"I always thought our relationship was cool
You played the role of having sense
I always played the fool
Now something's different
I don't know the reason why
Whenever we separate
I almost want to cry

[Chorus]
Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head

And when I come home late you don't complain or call
So as a consequence I don't go out at all
My friends are frightened
They don't know what's going on
They think you put a spell on me
And now my mind is gone

[Chorus]

Love's not so bad they say
But you never know where love is gonna go

Does anybody really know?

I'm standing at the altar
As they play the wedding march
I'm in a black tuxedo with my collar full of starch
She looks as lovely as she's ever gonna get
I wake up from this nightmare in a pool of sweat

[Chorus]

What you gonna do
What you gonna do when it comes and gets you?",5
"I don't have a need to be the best
Don't want to be just like the rest
Just stay who I am
Just an ordinary middle man
Give me the happy medium
Don't want to be the one whose leading them
I've got no master plan
Just a simple mddle man

Standing on a fine line between this and that
Just biding my time waiting for a sign
To tell me that I'm something special

My ideas are mine alone
Not yours, not theirs, but I care
I hurt for you, but not with you
I love that thing that's inside you
But I'm not your fan
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I'm your middle man

But I'm not your fan
I'm a stranger in a strange land
I am your middle man",6
"Buy and die, or sell and be free
We are the new Jacks, this is our reality
Do unto others, leave no one alive
This is our creed, we will survive
No control is how I'm living
On the edge with no forgiving

Things get rough when you've got time to kill
You've got the cash, then I've got your thrill
I make more money than a judge or a cop
Give me a reason why I should stop

Large is how I'm living
On the edge with no forgiving

Some people say my soul is lost
I'll lose my life if I start to turn soft
From where I am there's no turning back
Crack is the master
I am a new Jack

Can anybody see me?
Can anybody hear me?

I'll never change, I'll never stop
I've got cold cash, I'm on the top
We can get busy if you want to play
I'll have the last laugh when I blow you away

Can't you hear me?",6
"Now you can tear a building down
But you can't erase a memory
These houses may look all run down
But they have a value you can't see...

This is my neighborhood
This is where I come from
I call this place my home
You call this place a slum
You want to run all the people out
This what you're all about
Treat poor people just like trash
Turn around and make big cash

[Chorus:]
Now you can tear a building down
But you can't erase a memory
These houses may look all run down
But they have a value you can't see

Last month there was a fire
I saw seven children die
You sent flowers to their family
But your sympathy's a lie
Cause every building that you burn
Is more blood money that you earn
We are forced to relocate
From the pain that you create

[Chorus]

We lived here for so many years
Now this house is full of fear
For a profit you will take control
Where will all the older people go?
There used to be when kids could play
Without the scourge of drug's decay
Now our kids are living dead
They crack and blow their lives away

[Chorus]

You've got to fight
You've got a right
To fight for your neighborhood!",5
"When I speak out loud
You say I'm crazy
When I'm feeling proud
You say I'm lazy
I look around and see the true reality

You like our hair
You love our music
Our culture's large, so you abuse it
Take time to understand, I'm an equal man

[Chorus]
History's a lie that they teach you in school
A fraudulent view called the golden rule
A peaceful land that was born civilized
Was robbed of its riches, its freedom, its pride

When I'm at work you say I'm great
You watch and ponder, but can you relate?
Inviting eyes hands drop, when the music stops

Don't ask me why I play this music
It's my culture, so naturally I use it
I state my claim to say, it's here for all to play

[Chorus]

It's time for a change
Concepts rearrange
Can't you feel my rage

It's up to you to seek the truth
To know your history, the difference between me and you
Relate to me as me, not what you see on TV

All the rivers have died
Moment by moment, day by day
The world is just slipping away
Your future won't save your past
The time is now, it won't last
The time is nigh
Time to do-or-die

Time waits for no one

What is the purpose of joy?
Is it true that the winner dies

A lifetime twisting in pain
A lifetime gone in an hour

Now go away
Now go away

"How carefully I've shaped you in the solitude of days
How peaceful is my mind entwined in cord around my fingers
How sweet the days I've marked in knots I've tenderly caressed

So many times I've touched you, reached you, teased you
Now fingering these veins of hemp
Their hair upon my skin
And how gently, quickly you will sleep

Slip into my collection with its bristles, coils, intentions
Yet your words will be unfaithful before I set you free
Slip as life is bound to slip from this entropy disorder
Then tied and laid upon the floor in perfect symmetry
'Til the frayed edge of your lips on mine
Positioned, placed at ease once more

'Til this restlessness returns I turn and turn and turn again",6

So I get away when things get rough

Pay my bills and stay alive
All the world's problems ain't my fault
I take it all with a grain of salt

Ignorance is bliss
Problem sloved with just one kiss
Ignorance is bliss
Problem sloved with just one kiss

Ignorance

Ignorance is no excuse
Your problem's solved but what's the use
Ignorance is no excuse
The problem's solved then what's the use

But nobody listens to a word I say

Sometimes it's worse than that stupid TV

"A day of repetition, in this shadow factory
It doesn't look much like freedom to me
It's operation mind control
It's the battle for America's soul
It's operation mind control

Just try on this straight jacket, of conformity
While we force feed you propaganda, on the state TV
It's operation mind control
It's the battle for America's soul
It's operation mind control
It's the battle for America's soul

Your under 24 hour surveillance
By the satellite spies
We'll always be watched by
The all seeing eye

(Behold a pale Horse)
In God we Trust (What's the matter with you)

In God we Trust (What's the matter with you, this is mind control)

They put you in the cold, cold ground

My suffering is nobody's blame

Everyday it's all just the same

They put you in the cold, cold ground

Throwing stones in a pocket of tears

Caught myself having nothing, nothing
Caught myself having nothing
Caught myself having nothing, nothing at all

The sun will shine when you're gone
The wind will blow on without her

It is being

That love is all
And love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing

That ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing

Color of your dreams
It is not living

"Now you can tear a building down
But you can't erase a memory
These houses may look all run down
But they have a value you can't see...
This is my neighborhood
This is where I come from
I call this place my home
You call this place a slum
You want to run all the people out
This what you're all about
Treat poor people just like trash
Turn around and make big cash

[CHORUS:]
Now you can tear a building down
But you can't erase a memory
These houses may look all run down
But they have a value you can't see

Last month there was a fire
I saw seven children die
You sent flowers to their family
But your sympathy's a lie
Cause every building that you burn
Is more blood money that you earn
We are forced to relocate
From the pain that you create

[CHORUS]

We lived here for so many years
Now this house is full of fear
For a profit you will take control
Where will all the older people go?
There used to be when kids could play
Without the scourge of drug's decay
Now our kids are living dead
They crack and blow their lives away

You've got to fight
You've got a right
To fight for your neighborhood",5

I'll be in love with you.

I don't know how to be soft
I've become hard just to survive
But I long to become gentle
Gentleness brings love alive.
Take these two strong hands
Soften them darling understand
I will be in love with you,
I'll be in love with you.

I will be in love with you,
I'll be in love with you.",6
"There's a festival today
Come and see it's all so fine,
People who are not my kind are here
There's a festival today
The world is changing fresh and new
It's mostly green with bits of blue
But it's all here for you
And here's all you have to do:

[Chorus]
Get up, get up
Get out of bed.
Let the sunshine fill your head
Listen to what your friends have said.
Get up, get out of bed.

Morning with a quick yawn
I'll be gone.
I'll be hurrying on my way.
I hear there's a bad cat
On your back
And you'd best stay in today.
And tomorrow I'm here to say:

[Chorus]

Can you see me clearly?
Lover I do not know.
Can you hear me nearly?
Oh and I do think so,
Then you ain't got far to go.

"If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone 

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love 

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah 

If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love 

Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah",7
"They say the neon lights are bright
On Broadway 
They say there's always magic in the air 
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't have enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you fine
On Broadway 
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues 
How ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes
 
They say that I won't last too long 
On Broadway 
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say 
But they get wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

I won't quit till I'm a star
On Broadway 
On Broadway 
On Broadway",5
"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,

Birds fly over the rainbow

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",6
"Rosie crossed the Rio Grande
In the middle of the night she swam
With all she could carry
In a plain cloth sack
Heading for the promised land
Never coming back

Friends and family stayed behind
To haul the crops at harvest time
They think about Rosie
And all those nights
She spent thinking of
Her city lights

City lights shining in her eyes
Spreading out like Christmas lights
Under California skies
When the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's got those city lights
To help her find her way

Times were hard and the jobs were few
City lights were so brand new
Down in the barrio
Good times were hard to find
So Rosie packs her cares
And up the hill she climbs
To see those

City lights shining in her eyes
Spreading out like Christmas lights
Under California skies
When the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's got those city lights
To help her find her way

Rosie never wants
Those dreams to fade away
Never wants to let the rain
Spoil a sunny day
So when the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's go those city lights
To help her find her way

City lights shining in her eyes
Spreading out like Christmas lights
Under California skies
When the sun goes down
And those dreams begin to fade
She's got those city lights
To help her find her way",5
"Yes I'm Falling
Oh oh falling
Falling in love with you
Was easy as the day
A down man looked up to see
Nice things in his way
Falling in love with you
Was like that first sunrise
Was it in my window
Or was it in your eyes

And I call myself an island
And luckily I find
That you're the sea around me
And are with me for all time

Falling in love with you
Was learning how to cry
And telling you I'm all alone
Oh please don't pass me by
Falling in love with you
Was learning how to see
That you are you and I am me
And how fine that can be

And I call myself an island
And luckily I find
That you're the sea around me
And are with me for all time",7
"My telephone rang I was too late
Why did I stop to hesitate
On my way home
Take my hands let me confess
'Bout loving and hating and all of the rest
And ideas I've roamed

Then I saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and
Find I'm blind

My thoughts they make a tender smile
My hands they move and in a while
I've got what I want.
That tenderness that you insist you feel
Ain't worth a damn 'cause it ain't real
Lord it sure does haunt.

Then you saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find you're blind.

See me in a lonely Sunday
If you've got the time
And don't surprise me or you'll find
That I'm completely blind.

Now I'm so sick of what's being said
My thoughts they burn inside my head
There's not much untouched.
All of my children begin to cry
They clutch at me demanding why
Tell 'em 'bout loving and such.

Then they saw a brilliant sign
And let it slip behind
And search again and find they're blind.

See them in a lonely Sunday
If you've got the time
And don't surprise them or you'll find
That they're completely blind
That they're completely blind.",5
"Matthew was a country boy
Until one day he found
That cheatin' folks was easier
Than plowin' his daddy's ground

He left his farm in Ohio
Bound for Chicago town
He crossed Big Jim and turned his back
A bullet laid him down

And as he lay there dying
He begged, ""Will I see my Ohio?""
In my reply, I lied a bit
And said I did not know

Jim McCall was meek and small
And to become a man
He'd have to build himself up tall
With fancy folks and land

He threw some stones at honest friends
And got himself these things
His children left him and he sneered
""That's what my kindness brings""

And in the South End he got lost
And asked me where to go
In my reply, I lied a bit
And said I did not know

And lazy Susan called me up
She'd heard I stole the show
In my reply I lied a bit
And said I did not know
In my reply I lied a bit
And said I did not know

"I believe that life is free
I believe we're meant to be
As fine and lovely as you are
You're great to be around.

I believe our hearts can find
A way to push back all that time
I'm on the line
Waiting for your call.

When I saw you in that grocery aisle
You were walking that walk, smiling that smile
One by one the years roll off
And away go all those miles.

I believe we are brand new
Every day you make it true
I believe in love
And I'm in love with you.",7
"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",6
"First time you fall for somebody 
The world becomes your lucky star 
You wander around like a peacock 
With your lover on your arm 

Next time you fall 
You think you've heard it all 
No one could turn your insides out 
And your friends hear you say 
If your heart slips away 
I'll wonder what its all about 

And it's first time love, giving you fever 
Second time love, cooling your brow 
Finally love takes your hand in the dark 
And leads you home somehow 

So never say never another 
Just because somebody broke your heart 
Get your chin off the floor 
You'll never know what's in store 
If you don't give love a chance to start 
And if you don't believe in following feelings 

It's never too late to start 
Cause when you open your eyes 
Then you'll realize 
I'm the one who's chasing your heart 

Well it's first time love, giving you fever 
Second time love, cooling your brow 
Finally love takes your hand in the dark 
And leads you home somehow 

And it's first time love making your heart beat 
Second time love making it stop 
Finally love picks you up from the bottom 
And leads you home some how. ",6

Everybody wants V.I.P. wit the baggage

Chicken heads see me, actin' like I'm Jay-Z
Change the game, say my name, platinum chain
Can't wait in line, plus you know it's bout to rain
Ask the man at the door, is it cool?
And if not, slide him this, you know just what to do
But uh, I don't trip, it ain't all about me
'Cause not everyone can be V.I.P

Spendin' they rent dough, just to match my cheese

I'm Playa Lo, baby, and that's the gang
I'm V.I.P. status just because of my name
I steps right in wit a devilish grin
I told you cats last time I like to stay on cloud ten
Sippin' bumpy face water, at the club freakin' ya daughter
If she takes one mo' drink, sorry, man, I got her
I'm wearin' Prada, sike, nigga, I ain't
But the clothes that I wear just might make ya faint
I'm iced out, rollin' candy paint
Hey, put me on the list, dog! Naw, dog, I ain't!
Paid him a couple dollars and getcho ass in
If you ain't got no gold, there goes ya girlfriend, I'm a playa!

I came to get a hoe, I rock that big ice
My name is Livio, I got to live life
I got this thick chain, I kick that sick game
I make my own ends, I ride on chrome rims
A bunch of chicken heads outside kickin' eggs
My dogs is feelin' hungry, that's why we gettin' fed
Believe it, I run this, you cannot be by me
And don't even bump this if ya not V.I.P., woo

Some forever, not for better

There is no one compares with you

Smilin' by now
With my heart on the mend.

But when I try
Something in that heart says ""No"".
You're still there
I wish I didn't love you so.",6
"I met a boy called Frank Mills
On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""
I would gratefully appreciate if you see him tell him
I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",5

It wears a nicer face in my beautiful balloon
We can sing a song and sail along the silver sky

Up, up and away

Suspended under a twilight canopy
We'll search the clouds for a star to guide us
If by some chance you find yourself loving me
We'll find a cloud to hid us, keep the moon beside us

Love is waiting there in my beautiful balloon
Way up in the air in my beautiful balloon
If you'll hold my hand we'll chase your dream across the sky
For we can fly, we can fly

I'd never feel anything quite like that
Oh, bad habit, I can't be without
Oh, bad habit, bittersweet on my mouth
We got a long, drawn-out story
I don't want to explain
I picked up a bad habit
And I'll never be the same
I'll light it up, breathe it in
Let it all go, and I'll do it again
Light it up, breathe it in
I swear it almost feels like him
I remember when it felt like the first time
There ain't nothing like a first time
Bad habit, I'm gonna put you out
Oh, bad habit, I will miss you on my mouth
But we had a long, drawn-out story
And it was bound to end someday
Oh, bad habit, oh, bad habit
I'll never be the same",4
"Take me to heart and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unsure

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man

They say that it's a man's world
Well you can improve that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me

"Been down in the dumps for a day or two
Thinkin' baby, it was time for me to make a move
Late night skyline that's when it hit me
Well, I got to have me some of that New York City

Now, I was leaving San Diego in a Chevrolet van
I, out across the desert into no man's land
I just love the west you know, sure it's pretty
But I got to have me some of that New York City

I've been away too long and I got the itch
To do a little time in the east coast nitch
Down on Broadway and do a little diddy
Smack dab in the middle of New York City, oh yeah

I've been away too long and I got the itch
To do a little time in the east coast nitch
Down on Broadway and do a little diddy
Smack dab in the middle of New York City, oh yeah

The ocean on my left and the mountains on my right
To leave it all behind sure seemed like a pity
But I got to have me some of that New York City, oh yeah, oh yeah",5
"I saw someone again today who remembered me and you
They asked all the same old questions, I gave the same excuse
They said, ""What a shame, what a shame, to lose a love so fine""

But I never lost you, I never lost you
I never lost you, you were never mine

I kept on believing what I wanted to believe
The unspoken promises that you could never keep
But it's a sin, oh, it's a sin to tell yourself a lie

I never lost you, I never lost you
I never lost you, you were never mine

Did you give me all that you gave me just because I needed you
But when I needed, all your love completely was it more than you could do

Sometimes deep in the night when I hold you in my dreams
I get lost in your loving touch, baby, I can't believe how real it seems
And I know, yes I know, I'll have you till the end of time

'Cause I never lost you, I never really lost you
I never lost you 'cause you were never mine
I never lost you, I never really lost you
How could I lose you, you were never mine",6

It makes me want to rough you up so badly
Makes me want to roll you up in plastic
Toss you up and pump you full of lead

Johnny, my love, get out of the business

That I have got a bright and shiny platter
And I am gonna get your heavy head

I ask because I'm a real cunt in spring
You can rent me by the hour
I know all about the ugly pilgrim thing
Entertainers bring May flowers

So Johnny, my love, we got us a witness
Now all we gotta do is get a preacher
He can probably skip the ""until death"" part

"And when I asked for a separate room
It was late at night and we'd been driving since noon
But if I'd known how that would sound to you
I would have stayed in your bed for the rest of my life
Just to prove I was right

That it's harder to be friends than lovers
And you shouldn't try to mix the two
'Cause if you do it and you're still unhappy
Then you know that the problem is you
And it's true that I stole your lighter
And it's also true that I lost the map

But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to
I had to take your word on that
But if you'd known how that would sound to me
You would have taken it back

And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Boxed it up and buried it in the ground
Burned it up and thrown it away

You put in my hands a loaded gun
And then told me not to fire it
When you did the things you said were up to me
And then accused me of trying to fuck it up

But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
And maybe you'll be alright

And the license said you had to stick around until I was dead
But if you're tired of looking at my face, I guess I already am
But you've never been a waste of my time
It's never been a drag
So take a deep breath and count back from ten

Out on a bender
Just Alice falling down a deepening hole

You're about as old and piled

Used to pray for snow
Now I just wonder
What spell I was under

There was a crater with my name on it and a really good view

And the shit-brown reservoir is a testament to the dogs of L.A.
They hold the place like the mafia, and say, ""Run me around again.""

New York is three thousand miles away

But it's better than always running back into you
I've closed my eyes and my bank account
And gone west, young man

Take off the parking brake
Go coasting into a different state
And I'm not looking forward to missing you
But I must have something better to do
I've got to tear my life apart
And go west, young man

And it feels like I've got something to prove
But in some ways it's just something to do
My friends turn me around and say,
""You go west, young man.""

Stepping down off my platform shoes
Sixty-nine in the afternoon
And I'm waiting for someone in the know
Like Pirner tells me on the radio
Says ""Take it from someone who's been there before,
You go west, young man.""

And I'm looking for somebody to do my thinking for me
Till I come through
The state-line highway sign says,
""You have gone west, young man.""

You were miles above me

And I'm starting to actually feel it seep through the slick divide now
I don't crack the door too far for anyone who's pushing too hard on me

They don't know what they like so much about it
Maybe it goes on the other side of the hallway

In case the big boys called you up
You're gonna have to let 'em dick you around
But don't let 'em make you do what you can't live with
Tonight in bed with me sleeping

Where do you get the fuck off thinking I was there at the party
'Cause all my friends feed me the evil reasons
Why you and I should not be friends?
Let's think this whole thing through
Tell me, just what the hell is a lover supposed to do?
I got the wrong reaction, a slap in the face from you

This is such a stupid picture
Wrap me in a steak
Why don't you throw me in the panther cage
And maybe then I'll like you better
(No way!)

I don't need a support system
Lifting me into prop position
What they make is a separation of beauty from attitude
What satisfaction is left when all you do
Tells everyone you're acting untrue?

This is such a stupid picture
Light a cigarette
Why don't you stub it in the carborateur
And maybe then you'll sell me something
(No way!)

I don't need a support system

You said you had a lot of work to do 
But I heard the rest in your head 
And almost immediately I felt sorry 
'Cause I didn't think this would happen again 
No matter what I could do or say 
Just that I didn't think this would happen again 
With or without my best intentions 

And I want a boyfriend 
I want a boyfriend 
I want all that stupid old shit like letters and sodas 
Letters and sodas

I can feel it in my bones 
I'm gonna spend another year alone 
It's fuck and run, fuck and run 
Even when I was seventeen 
Fuck and run, fuck and run 
Even when I was twelve 

You almost felt bad 
You said that I should call you up 
But I knew much better than that 
And almost immediately I felt sorry 
'Cause I didn't think this would happen again 
No matter what I could do or say 
Just that I didn't think this would happen again 
Without or without my best intentions 

I can feel it in my bones 
I'm gonna spend my whole life alone 
It's fuck and run, fuck and run 
Even when I was seventeen 
Fuck and run, fuck and run 
Even when I was twelve",5
"You took the car
It was my favorite one 
Little white Dart
And drove it to Idaho 
You took the horse
It was a thoroughbred
Saddled it up
Out on the interstate
You killed the cat
Burned it in antifreeze
Dumped in the trunk
With the rest of the cattlefeed
You took the house
You went and changed the locks
Now I am stuck
Living out of a box

"He's just a hero
In a long line of heroes
Looking for something attractive to save
They say he rode in
On the back of a pickup
And he won't leave town 
'Til you remember his name

He's just a hero
In a long line of heroes
Looking for some lonely billboard to grace
They say he sprung from the skull of Athena
Think about your own head
And the headache he gave

He's just a hero
In a long line of heroes
Looking for action at a price he can pay
They say he's famous
But no one can prove it
Make him an offer just to see what he'll say

Check out the dashboard lights
Glowing all green and white
He feels safe in the dark
He wears his bluejeans tight

He's just a hero
In a long line of heroes
Looking for something attractive to save
They say he rode in
On the back of a pickup
And he won't leave town 
'Til you remember his name

Check out the thinning hair
Check out the aftershave
Check out America
You're looking at it babe",6
"I was flying into Chicago at night
Watching the lake turn the sky into blue-green smoke
The sun was setting to the left of the plane
And the cabin was filled with an unearthly glow
In 27-D, I was behind the wing
Watching landscape roll out like credits on a screen

The earth looked like it was lit from within
Like a poorly assembled electrical ball
As we moved out of the farmlands into the grid
The plan of a city was all that you saw
And all of these people sitting totally still
As the ground raced beneath them, thirty-thousand feet down

It took an hour, maybe a day
But once I really listened the noise just fell away

And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video
The stewardess came back and checked on my drink
In the last strings of sunlight, a Brigitte Bardot
As I had on my headphones
Along with those eyes that you get
When your circumstance is movie-size

It took an hour, maybe a day
But once I really listened the noise just fell away

It took an hour, maybe a day
But once I really listened the noise just fell away
But once I really listened the noise just fell away",5
"I'm gonna tell my son to grow up pretty as the grass is green
And whip-smart as the English Channel's wide
And I'm gonna tell my son to keep his money in his mattress
And his watch on any hand between his thighs
And I'm gonna lock my son up in a tower
Till I write my whole life story on the back of his big brown eyes

When they do the double dutch, that's them dancing [Repeat: x4]

I'm gonna tell my son to join a circus so that death is cheap
And games are just another way of life
And I'm gonna tell my son to be a prophet of mistakes
Because for every truth there are half a million lies
And I'm gonna lock my son up in a tower
Till he learns to let his hair down far enough to climb outside

When they do the double dutch, that's them dancing [Repeat: x4]",5
"Wild thing
You made the boys spring
You made everything expensive
Spend it, spend it, wild thing
There's hardly a man left around that you haven't sought out
There's hardly a dress shop in town that you haven't bought out
In case you're wondering why the hair salon wouldn't take you
There's hardly a woman left in any state that doesn't hate you

Wild thing
You made the boys spring
You made everything expensive
Spend it, spend it, wild thing
It's truly awesome

When she was younger she thought her mother had missed her calling
And she, in turn, thought that her daughter's conduct was appalling
After each date she had the boys, went home and dreamed of spiders
She never fell for any man who wasn't rich as midas

Wild thing
You made the boys spring
You made everything expensive
Spend it, spend it, wild thing
It's truly awesome

If there's a lesson to be learned then i'm sure i don't know it
We've all been waiting twenty years to see her finally blow it
But as far as i can tell she's happy, rich, and worry-free
And that's a hell of a lot more than i can say for me

Wild thing
You made the boys spring
You made everything expensive
Spend it, spend it wild thing

Wild thing
You made your heart sing
You bought everything you wanted
Spend it, spend it, wild thing
It was truly awesome

"Baby got goin' on a southern train, you know
Fired up pistons drivin' below
And the whole vibration, seat upholstery
Silky underwear, oh conductor let's roll
Let's roll!

Baby got goin' but I can't complain, you know
It knocks me out when she acts so strange,
It's like a Big Mac truck cut across two lanes in my soul
Conductor, let's throw some metal down, roll!
Let's roll!

Baby got goin' when the train kept a rollin' [Repeat: x4]

Squeeze her knees underneath a book, you know
A real good shakin' is all it took
Cause my baby's hooked on me
And as you can see I'm wild about her!

She got goin' but I can't complain, you know
It knocks me out when she acts so strange
It's like a Big Mac truck cut across two lanes in my soul

She gets mad when it goes too slow,
So I'm beggin' you man keep a-shovelin' that coal and let's roll!
Let's roll

I do think I see through you

One night is lovely, the next is brutal
And you and me are in way over our heads with this one

Moderation is a memory
Dive right in and let him send me
I could take this in doses large enough to kill

He's got diamonds on the bed of his thumbnails and I
Never realized I was so dirty and dry
Till he knocked me down, started dragging me around
In the back of his convertible car

And I liked it
I liked it more and more

Crimson and clover, soon he's taken over all my senses now

In spite of all they say
Become something strange and beautiful
Like joy, like joy

Me, I'm like a wild flame that catches on whatever's near but
Your mind is a firewalker, it sets its course and never veers but

I can grow
In spite of all you know
You might not recognize me tomorrow
Yes I can change
In spite of all they say
Become something strange and beautiful
Like joy, like joy

Take offers from every side and give my attentions about anywhere well
Do I recognize my actions, I look like I'm so unaware like
I don't care

But I can grow
In spite of all you know
You might not recognize me tomorrow
Yes I can change
In spite of all they say
Become something strange and beautiful
Like joy, like joy",7
"Not a lot of patience
You're not a patient man
Don't have a heart to stay with
You get it while you can
Just because you can
Get out of it

And I wasted your time, didn't I and
That that's the reason we fight all the time
It's been so long since you've been a friend of mine

Gonna take a vacation
Stop chasing what I lack
Am I gonna get blown off
As soon as I get back
On another track
Without you

'Cause I don't have the heart to try
One more false start in life
It's been so hard to get it right
Seems like the moment I catch up
The farther you fly

And I wasted your time, didn't I and
That that's the reason we fight all the time
It's been so long since you've been a friend of mine

And I wasted your time, didn't I
And that's the reason we fight all the time
It's been so long since you've been a friend to me
It seems like I dreamed and now I'm waking up to daylight
What happened, when did you let go of me
I miss you so badly

It's been so long since you've been a friend of mine",5
"For the rest of my days I want you by my side
Tell me what can I say to keep you in my life
'Cause I can never relax
I've got to keep it exciting
Make it attractive
Keep it alive
Keep you coming back
I'm always so frightened you'll see through my act
When the fire is out and I've given up
You come running out, and you build it up

You tell me good love never dies
It only hurts when we burn our eyes
From staring too long at the sun
You gotta throw your hands up
And let the night come

Spoken: I like watching you out there. It's comforting.

Tell me what can I say to keep you in my life
All the words slip away when I look in your eyes
Because I can never relax
I've got to keep it exciting
Make it attractive
Keep it alive
Keep you coming back
I'm already fighting to keep what I have
When the fire is out and I've given up
You come running out, and you build it up

You tell me good love never dies
It only hurts when we burn our eyes
From staring too long at the sun
You gotta throw your hands up
And let the night come
Take your chances
And let the night come",6
"Give it to me, don't give it away
Don't think about what the others say
My skin's getting clear, my hair's so bright
All you do is fuck me every day and night

You're my secret beauty routine
Na na na na, what my body has seen
I am lookin' good and I'm feelin' nice
Baby, you're the best magazine advice

[Chorus:]
Gimme your hot white come [Repeat: x4]

I'm gonna pull you back down between the sheets
Everything is fresher when the day is sweet
In the morning light when you're already on the phone

Face it, one of these days
Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray
It's the fountain of youth, it's the meaning of life
So hot, so sweet, so whet my appetite

[Chorus]

Face it, one of these days
Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray
It's the fountain of youth, it's the meaning of life
Baby, you're the best magazine advice

Your hot white come",6
"Down on the lower east side
In the dirtiest apartment you could find
You took me up to your place
But the elevator threw me into space

And I really didn't even ask
What time it was
I could tell 'er we'd draw the curtain back

It's sweet
How you believe
You're in love with me
You're in love with me

You come 'round, open the gate
To a million empty bottles on the sink
You can over think any thing you want
But it really doesn't matter

'Cause it's sweet
To believe
You're in love with me
You're in love with me

In the early night
I catch you starin'
And you make a joke about it

It's sweet
How you believe
You're in love with me
You're in love with me

It's sweet
How you believe
You're in love with me
You're in love with me",6
"Dig little digger, don't be shy
You saw your mother with another guy
You think you'll tell her that she's one of a kind, you say
My Mother is mine

You put your trucks up on the bed next to him
So he can get a better look at them, you say
This ones my favorite one, this one you can't have
I got it from my Dad, you say
I got it from my Dad

Now you're thinking little thoughts about it
Taking every inch of him in
What does it mean when something changes how its always been
And in your head you keep repeating the line
My Mother is mine

I've done the damage, the damage is done
I pray to God that I'm the damaged one
In all these grown-up complications that you don't understand
I hope you can, someday
I hope you can

And now you're thinking little thoughts about it
Taking every inch of him in
What does it mean when something changes how its always been
And in your head you keep repeating the line
My Mother is mine

And now you're thinking little thoughts about it
Taking every inch of him in
What does it mean when something changes how its always been
And in your head you keep repeating the line
My Mother is mine",5
"Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold",5
"I love my bionic eyes
I love my crystal vision
If there's anybody out there
Baby I'm not gonna miss 'em

I watch the years go by
These are the same old guys I never had any use for
Beyond the feeling of pleasure
Or the thrill of the fight

I scored again last night
I said thanks for the drinks, nice party
Then I turned out the light

I've got timing and attitude
That can get to the baddest dude
That's when I hypnotize them
With my bionic eyes

As I got older I had to step out of the lines
And make up my own mind
As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever

It's easy in the beginning
When I can dazzle them
All night
Make 'em do what you wan' 'em to
Get 'em running after you
It's just the same old guys
Wearing the same old ties

As I got older I had to step out of the lines
And make up my own mind
As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever

I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes
I love my bionic eyes

If there's a parallel nation
And I'm a secret weapon
Show me a man you cannot break
And I will show you heaven

As I got older I had to step out of the lines
And make up my own mind
As I got light as a feather they got stiff as a board
I can't feel any more, but I can fake it forever",6
"Lying wide awake in the dark
Trying to figure out where you are
Always going nowhere
'Fraid of going somewhere
And somewhere's a place in your heart

Sometimes when I think about you
Why you're always running away
Sitting in your car
Changing who you are
And drowning the thoughts of your life in the music

[Chorus]
Scared the lights will turn green
You'll have to be seen
You'll be like anybody else
Scared the lights will turn red
You're stuck in your head
You can't commit to even her

How you gonna get through the year?
You can't 

Playing on the sides of the net
Too many people want too many things
And you only want to forget

[Chorus]

How you gonna make it through?

You're always listenin'
You're always listenin'
You're always listenin' to yourself

You're always thinkin'
You're always thinkin'
You knew what everybody else
Should do with their lives

Lying wide awake in the dark
Trying to figure out where you are
Always going nowhere
'Fraid of going somewhere
And somewhere's a place in your heart
Somewhere's a place in your heart

[Chorus: x2]

How you gonna get through the year?",5
"Oh baby you're young but that's okay
What's give or take nine years anyway
I'll bet you that cigarette
You won't regret my time

I want to be with a guy like you
So uncomplicated, so in tune
Just take off my dress
Let's mess with everybody's mind

I gotta tell you

Baby, baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
Baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
All night
Yeah rock me all night

Hey yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah

I want to play Xbox on your floor
Say hi to your roommate who's next door
You don't have a dime, but I don't mind
Who gives a damn

Your record collection don't exist
You don't even know who Liz Phair is
Your potential with no credentials
Your mother taught you how to be a sensitive man1
I gotta tell you

Baby, baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
Baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
All night
Yeah rock me all night

Hey yeah yeah
I've been waitin'
All my life for
Hey yeah yeah
For this feelin'
Who'd 've guessed it could rock, me, all, night
Rock, me, all, night

You think I'm a genius
Think I'm cool
I'm starting to think that young guys rule
Oh God, let me save you
And I might change you, and I might change my mind

Baby, baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
Baby, baby, if it's all right
Want you to rock me all night
All night
Yeah rock me all night",6
"I don't know what you're after
Wanna know all the details of my disaster
Like an accident on the side of the road
When you're driving past slow but there's nothing to see here

[Chorus:]
Wanna take a look, take a look [Repeat: x4]

I'm some kind of freak now and
You'll never see me the same
What's all the fuss about?
Are you sure you wanna find out?
Cause once you know the truth
You might wish you'd walked away

[Chorus]

What if I'm not able
To put my cards on the table?
And would it liberate you
If you knew what I knew?

It's been over a year now and
I never saw him again
The facts and the fiction
Collide as the bodies untangle
And the traffic moves on like it did

[Chorus: x2]",6
"I see the things you do
Do you think I wander through, half-blind?
I see the things you hide
The fear you have inside is nothing new

But I would never want to find out
Everything about you
Cause I would never want to find out
What I thought wasn't true

Your mind is a place I don't need to embrace
What you've got in your heart is enough
For me to start breaking through
Closer to you
Closer to you

I love you as you are
Here and not too far
Out of view
I love the way you walk
To hear it when you talk
Like you do

But I would never want to choose
What I like best
About you
Cause I would never want to spoil
That mystery
With a clue

Your mind is a place I don't need to embrace
What you've got in your heart is enough
For me to start
With enough holes in my soul
I don't need your rock-n-roll to stay in tune
And open to you
Open to you

Oh the abyss
Mess of all those frustrating fools
They wander all around
Black and white, no sound, no improvements

But I see something on a TV
With a smell and a choice
When I feel yours and my heart beating
With the wealth of the universe

Your mind is a place I don't need to embrace
What you've got in your heart is enough
For me to start making your happiness my own
Open up and let me show what I can do
When I am closer to you
Closer to you",6
"Don't know where we'll be tomorrow
But we'll beg and borrow everything we need
You are standing next to me, Where I want to be
Is anywhere you are

Some day if we never said it
We might live to regret it
Come on, don't let us slip away in a daze

You can count on my love
An umbrella when it's raining
When you feel your hope is fading
You can count on my love

Blue eyes, bluer than the blue sky
Smiling down like sunshine
Everywhere you are
For you, I only want the best
You only have to ask
And I'll be there for you

Some day if we never said it
We might live to regret it
Come on, don't let us fade away in a haze

You can count on my love
An umbrella when it's raining
When you feel your hope is fading
You can count on my love
With me you'll feel protected
And you'll never be rejected
You can count on my love

You go through your whole life waiting
But you don't know what you're waiting for
One day you'll meet somebody
And your whole world now is an open door

You can count on my love
You can count on my love
An umbrella when it's raining
When you feel your hope is fading

You can count on my love
With me you'll feel protected
And you'll never be rejected
When you need a friend to lean on

You know you never need a reason
To count on my love
Count on my love
You can count of my love",7
"We have everything we need here
We have everything between us
You have nothing left to fear dear
Cause it ain't ever gonna leave us

We might get a room downtown now
Get away for a half day
We might drive a car to the next town
Get away from our family

Let your body move real slow
Tell your body we left yesterday
Let your body hold me close
Let your body move you
We have everything we need here
We have everything between us

"I bet it makes you laugh
Watching me work so hard to reach you
You never gave a damn
About all of those things I did to please you

All that you wanted, you found somewhere else
And nothing could drag you away from yourself

Do you really know me at all?
Would you take the time to catch me if I fall?
Are you ever gonna be that real to me?
Everything to me

Lucky I've been through hell
Backroads and shortcuts I know them well
Baby just stick with me
We'll make it together, just wait and see

Do you really know me at all?
Would you take the time to catch me if I fall?
Are you ever gonna be that real to me?
Everything to me

The walls they close in
The air it goes out
We're left with nothing but a shadow of doubt
Nobody talks, no one is here
It's just you and me

Do you really know me at all?
Would you take the time to catch me if I fall?
Are you ever gonna be that real to me?
Everything to me

Do you really know me at all?
Would you take the time to catch me if I fall?

"They can say, what they want
But I don't hear a thing 'cause they can't read, my thoughts
Or the secrets between us
All of this time you where a part of me
Shining like a star in my galaxy

And I reach out, trusting you there
It's like walking on a high wire into thin air
And I'm waking, up to the dream
It's like bouncing so high on a trampoline
And I know, that there's one thing
Between me and nothing
Baby, you are that something that pulls me through
So I'm giving it all to you

Giving it all to you

Could it be you and me?
Can't stop thinking about, all of the crazy possibilities
I don't want to keep my feelings locked inside
Every time I see you you just blow my mind

And I reach out, trusting you there
It's like walking on a high wire into thin air
And I'm waking, up to the dream
It's like bouncing so high on a trampoline
And I know, that there's one thing
Between me and nothing
Baby, you are that something that pulls me through
So I'm giving it all to you

Giving it...

Others have tried to get to me
But I see through them eventually
'Cause you're the only one that I wanna be with
I'm giving it all to you
I'm giving it all...

Every time I see you all my systems align
You explode on me just like a metorite

And I reach out, trusting you there
It's like walking on a high wire into thin air
And I'm waking, up to the dream
It's like bouncing so high on a trampoline
And I know, that there's one thing
Between me and nothing
Baby, you are that something that pulls me through
So I'm giving it all to you

I know that there's one thing
I know that there's one thing

Don't have to stand there with a drink because

"You fall hard
You fall deep
Even when you're awake
You look half asleep
Do you even know what you did last summer
Wandering around deaf, dumb and blind
With the girls all hanging around you

Is that no or yes
We'll have to guess
Mysterious eyes let you see what you want
Half the time you didn't know any better
But half the time you did
Hanging around like tomorrow doesn't apply to you

Lazy dreamer
You never want to rise
Stubborn in-betweener
You're almost paralyzed
Makes no difference to you
The sun shining in your eyes
Or the buzzer that's whining
They're waiting for you
They don't even realize
You're still out like a light

Still late at home
Bet that's you on the phone
Like a dog you show up
And wag your tail for a bone
Half the time you didn't know any better
But half the time you did
Hanging around like tomorrow doesn't apply to you

What the neighbors say
Lives in a room by himself
Nudge him awake and he blinks his eyes
Doesn't recognize anyone at all

"I saw John, he looked so sad
I want you to know that I feel bad for not making our dreams come true
We had so many dreams, me and you
I want you to know I love you
You're my favorite thing from the past
And all of those nights we spent together
I never had such a blast...

Anyone could tell you were my instrument, he said, I understand you
You wanna play me
Everything about us had an innocence, but everything around us was changing

It's hard to believe so much happened so fast
Remember the way we always left
While I'm thinking of the things you do
We were kings of the world, me and you
I wish it has stayed like that forever
But everyone was dropping off like flowers
I had so many friends in rehab
A couple who practically died

Anyone could tell you were my instrument, you said, I understand you
You wanna play me
Everything about us had an innocence, but everything around us was changing

And my mistake was being already married
I wanna make a leap of innocence to you

I guess when you were living the high life
It's one of those things that just can't last
Kind of like love in California
But I never had such a blast

Anyone could tell you were my instrument, you said, I understand you
You wanna play me
Everything about us had an innocence, but everything around us was changing

My mistake is thinking I'd already made it

This time it's true

We're stuck here with nothing to do
But I lean out the window and find paradise

That it seems like I may never know how
People stay in love for half of their lives
It's a secret they keep between husbands and wives

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me
But I look at myself
Wonderin' if I'm just too weak
To have such faith in myself

Once upon a time I was so restless in love
When things we're fine, I changed my mind just because
Now I see how wrong and reckless I've been
Each frog has a prince just waiting inside of him

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me
But I look at myself, and I think what the hell
Maybe I'm just too naive
To have such faith in myself
You know I'm praying for it

But the queen, she likes to sit on her throne
Doesn't mean you two are never alone
It's just love has needs that love only knows
Watch a couple stay close, It's like the bloom of a rose

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me
There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale

I never cry out loud, I
I keep my tears to myself
But I woke up one day and I found my life had left me for someone else
I, I guess it must be unhappy with me

Baby, There goes somebody's miracle
Walking down the street
There goes some other fairy tale
I wish it could happen to me

We all shine shine shine

Stars rise and
Stars fall
But the ones that the shine the brightest aren't stars at all
There the planets just like us
And from big to small

We all shine shine shine
We all shine shine shine
We all shine
Shine shine shine

We all shine shine shine
We all shine shine shine
We all shine
Shine shine shine

We all shine shine shine
We all shine shine shine
We all shine
Shine shine shine
We all shine shine shine
We all shine shine shine",5
"I'm walking down in the basement
I'm leaning on the washing machine
I'm reaching back through a hole in the wall's insulation
I'm pulling out a bottle of vodka
Replacing that with a pint of Jim Bean
I'm lying down on the floor until I feel better

It's morning and I pour myself coffee
I drink it til the kitchen stops shaking
I'm backing out of the driveway
And into creation

And the loving spirit that follows me
Watching helplessly, will always forgive me

Oh, I want to die alone
With my sympathy beside me
I want to bring down all those demons who drank with me
Feasting bleed through me
On my desperation

I hide all the bottles in places
They find and confront me with pain in their eyes
And I promise that I'll make some changes

But reaching back it occurs to me
There will always be some kind of crisis for me

Oh, I want to die alone
With my sympathy beside me
I want to bring back all those moments they stole from me
In my reverie
Darkening days end

Oh, I want to die alone
With my memories inside me
I want to live that life
When I could say people had faith in me
I still see that guy in my memory

Oh, I want to die alone
With my sympathy beside me
I want to bring down all those people who drank with me
Watching happily
My humiliation",6
"If you ask me why I lie to you
I can tell you I don't know myself
It's amazingly dishonest
But I'd have to recognize it
As part of myself

Straighten up
Why can't you straighten up
I've heard you tell me this
So many times
It doesn't even stick

I get it all the time
I get it all the time
You know I love to make
A joke of it

And if you ask me why I hurt you
I don't understand it
I can't help myself
Its a special combination
Of preditory instinct
And simple ill will

I would give some thought to it
If I thought that it might do me
Some good
Some good

Straighten up
Why can't you straighten up
You always say I'll lose
Control of it
And thirty is not too old

Well momma I would give some thought to it
If I thought that it might do me
Some good
Some good
Some good",7
"You lose your way
You've gotta land
You've gotta make another plan
But sometimes I am too tired

You've gotta smile
You've gotta play
You've gotta work another day
But sometimes I am too tired

You've gotta raise your hand and say
I don't understand
But there are days when I'm to tired
There are days when I'm just too tired
And the wind that I'm in
Screams on me
Howls around me

And I feel like I am a naked man
I've got nothing and no one in a stranger's land
And the wind will do me in

Everyday
You've gotta run
You've got a job
You get it done
But sometimes I am too tired

You wanna roll in the grass
Kick your shoes off
Have a laugh
But sometimes I am too tired

I wanna raise my hand and say
I don't understand
But there are days when I'm to tired
There are days when I'm just too tired
And the wind kicks in again and says
Lean on me
Rise above me
And it says
Sailor don't leave the channel now
Deep blue rollers are breaking across your bow
And the wind will guide you in

So I went up the mountain
But all I saw was another mountain
So I came down the mountain
And I said, ""leave me here lord""
So I went up the mountain
And all I saw was another mountain
So I came down the mountain
And I said, leave me here lord
Leave me in the valley
Let me rest my weary head
Give peace to your survivor
Put all my fears to bed

You lose your way
You've gotta land
You've gotta make another plan
But sometimes I am inspired

You're gonna sing another song
You're gonna right another wrong
And sometimes I am inspired

You're gonna raise your hand and say
I don't understand
There are days when you get an answer
There are days when you find your answer.",4
"Everything you've got is mine
And you won't get away with it this time
I'm coming for you with a wooden stake
Nail you right through you're heart and up to your gate

Ding dong, the witch is dead
Come out of your house, uncover your head
Dang dong, this crooked soul
Hanged himself on rock 'n roll

I mean, what kind of a kid were you when you were a kid
What kind of man would do what you did
What kind of life did you think you were gonna live
When everyone in town put a price on your head

Ding dong, the witch is dead
Come out of your house, uncover your head
Dang dong, this crooked soul
Hang yourself on rock 'n roll

The mob sang as the pitchforks rang
And the torch flames swung
Up to light the way ahead
He fled in the darkness and dread
And the tower it bled 'til it trembled and swayed
And he fell straight to Hell, and there he stayed
He fell straight to hell, and there he stayed

Ding dong, the witch is dead
Come out of your house, uncover your head
Dang dong, this crooked soul
Hang theirself on rock 'n roll
Ding dong, the witch is dead
Come out of your house, uncover your head
Dang dong, this crooked soul
Hang yourself on rock 'n roll",6
"Oh, let me pull it all back
This runaway train is running out of track
No more tricks in the old trick-sack
The minutes tick by 'til the watch face turns black

I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?

On the phone
But you're not at home
And the trees are blown
By the wind
Please let me say,
I had a hard one today
I never could feel ok
Alone

I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?
I wanna go 
Bang, bang, bang, bang?",5
"The trick to happiness is to ignore anything negative you might
Feel about yourself
That people don't really like you that much
That you got fat because you are lonely
Or that your parents are going to die

I like to get my coffee with all the little frothy things on the side
And I like to put in those little sticks

The trick to freedom is to deny your past regrets
Questionable lovers, lies, drunken weekends

I just like to have a lot of energy
My life demands it
Everything's up, all the time
Up, up, up!

[Chorus]
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
How high? to the sky!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
What's the beat? The beat is up, ah!
How high? to the sky!

People like positive people
Positivity makes good things happen

My husband doesn't let me buy those tabloid magazines
'Cause he says that it makes me fight with him more

Pills that you mix with wine
That your husband and you aren't having sex anymore
That you got married for the money
It's been positively proved that most top 40 hits have a BPM
Of one twenty or more

I definitely like the gin-song
And the ginko bal-boa?

[Chorus]

Sometime you picture yourself getting impaled
On an imaginary spike sticking out from over your bed
When you keep forgetting to call somebody back
But the more time goes by, the less you feel like calling
Because you're embarrassed

'Cause it kind makes you freaky
And you don't want people to think you're freaky
Even though you are kind of freaky
But only in the bedroom
L-O-L

My mom says I'm really hard on my kids
I don't want them growing up thinking
That everything's just going to be handed to them
They're going to have to work their asses off, just like I did!
You know, we get them up at six in the morning
We're like 'come on! get up! get outta bed!'
'It's gonna be a great day C'mon! up, up, up!'

[Chorus]",6
"I was tripping looking at my portfolio
Wondering how I was gonna make enough dough y'know
Called up a friend who wrote for One Tree Hill and Jericho
He had a job for me, and check it, with a four-letter company

Get it on
Get it on

Hey, I got a proposition for ya
How 'bout you let me keep my profits as a scorer
Record sales are shrinking, I'm gettin' poorer
I got a kid to feed, how about you cut a deal with me

Ha! Hey look, Liz we see you as a commodity
We've been with you since Day One and that's an oddity

And after a series of phone calls
To the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor,
I reached my representative, who pulled out the contract
From the File Cabinet
On microfiche
In the form of Tablets
Made of stone
Then he said

Let me see, it's here in my folder
Oh shit, you're twenty years older
Still hot, but getting a lot colder
And you wanna cut a what with me

Let me tell you how it's done here in the Hollywood
Maybe you was thinking you was in the Bollywood
If I wanna break the rule, you know I probably could

Liz, I'd love to help you out
But we have what we call Standards & Practices

In legal terms, we're referring to this as a recoupable interest
In an artist's compositions on vinyl, plastic, digital
And all transmittable airwaves
For a period of no less than six or nine years
In all territories of the Earth
The solar system and the known universe

And I replied

Listen here, my dear little Roni
Don't you give me no phoney-baloney
This is not my first Pretty Pony
Don't you know you're fucking with me

Oh, it's a bad day for the pool boy
Come to clean, and discover you, boy
Face down and feet turning blue, boy
Now your eyes are closed, you finally have the sight to see

It's all mine
It's all mine
It's all mine",5
"Well, I've been in this garden of Eden a long time
And I've never seen Adam do anything I understand
When I see you gunning for me double four time
Then I probably haven't been doing the best that I can

So if you miss how we were in September
And you wonder if I know what we had
Well, I'm sorry that you have to remember
But don't be sad
Because I've been happy too
Yes, I have
I wanna spend my life with you

They've got you in ropes and they're prodding you all night
The lion must roar if the crowd's gonna fill up the stands
Right now it's struggle to just hold your head high
Well, baby, hang on, 'cos I'm coming as fast as I can

So if you miss how we were in September
And you wonder if I know what we had
Well, I'm sorry that you have to remember
But don't be sad
Because I've been happy too
Every day
I wanna spend my time with you

And I'll take you down
Through your pain, and your tears, break it down
And I'll stay in your eyes 'til you sleep
And I'll lay with your prize inside of me
Keep it calm, and keep it safe
Until you awake

I've been happy too
Yes, I have
I wanna spend my life with you

I've been happy too
Every day
I wanna spend my time with you",6
"Take a good look at your dead-end life
Tell me you don't long for the good times
Just a moment to your self again
Worries disappear where you begin

You got a lot more money and my bitch got style
Gonna drive that honey down the road for a while
Take me far away
Got no reason left to stay

My my all good
Feels a bit better than it should
Could've been a good girl but I'm not
Little attitude is what I got

My my all good
Feels a bit better than it should
Could've been lies could've been free
Could've been something in between

Take a slow train to a better place
Wake up somewhere to a sweeter face
Life is short before you realize
You're pushing daisies straight up to the sky

You got a lot more money and my bitch got style
Gonna tap that honey and they come for miles
To take me on the road
Gonna lose my self-control

My my all good
Feels a bit better than it should
Could've been a good girl but I'm not
Little attitude is what I got
My my all good

Feels a bit better than it should
Could've been lies could've been free
Could've been something in between

Take this person you've never known
Find a love you can call your own
Someday maybe you'll recognize
That your beauty lies inside
If you'd just let it out sometime

Oh come on
Oh come on

My my all good
Feels a bit better than it should
Could've been a good girl but I'm not
Little attitude is what I got

My my all good
Feels a bit better than it should
Could've been a good girl but I'm not

"Why do you treat me so good
With all the love that you have
You chase me into the wood
And feed my baby-bird mouth

I turn my back for a moment
And all the love starts to swell
Don't need no pill to take me under
And love you so well

Wake up and sing
Wake up dancing
Wake up and sing

How dare you be you, how dare I be me
The two of us lost in our own fantasy
Oh, Bangladesh, you're all I think of
And nothing, oh nothing is ever enough

Wake up and sing
Wake up dancing
Wake up and sing

Wake up dancing
Wake up and sing
Wake up and sing

Why do you treat me so good
With all the mess that I'm in
I feel the reach of the cue
Whenever we begin
You shoot your ball in my pocket
And all the love starts to swell
One good reason to get under
And love you so well

Wake up and sing
Wake up dancing
Wake up and sing

Oh, Bangladesh, how could you believe
There's nowhere on earth that I'd rather be
With Hell down below and Heaven above
And nothing, oh nothing
Nothing, oh nothing
Wake up dancing
Nothing
Wake up and sing
Is never enough",7
"I fell in love along the way, somewhere I couldn't stay
But it's nice to take a detour sometimes
You drove me out in your rented car, we didn't have to go too far
To look back on the city lights

Some things aren't that different
But other things, they change

You've got the world at your feet, with everything you need
Tell me, are you satisfied?
It all comes easily to you, with everything you do
Tell me, are you satisfied?

I came, I saw, I kicked its ass
I walked away, and I never looked back
I remember you, when you held my hair
As I puked, oh, everywhere

Some things aren't that different
But other things, they change

You've got the world at your feet, with everything you need
Tell me, are you satisfied?
It all comes easily to you, with everything you do
But tell me, are you satisfied?

I want to be like you
You want to be like me

You've got the world at your feet, with everything you need
But tell me, are you satisfied?
It all comes easily to you, with everything you do
But tell me, are you satisfied?

I felt it turn along the way, somewhere I couldn't stay

"Not supposed to talk about it
Analyze it
We should be there together
With our hearts in our hands
We should feel it
Come together
Like the wave meets the sand
Well, you should know me better than that

Not supposed to try and move in
To dive in
We should meet there together
At our pace, with our plan
On dry land
Clement weather
So we both understand
Well, you should know me better than that

I get down
I get up
I get angry
I get sad
I get sad
I get even a little misty
When I think of what we had
But you're building a dam where our lives should be
And you're lying on top of the beauty
And your closing eyes turn away from me
Refusing to see who I am
Well, you should know me better than that
You should know me better than that",5
"Everybody's had a few
Now they're talking about who knows who
I'm going back to the Crescent City
Where everything's still the same
This town has said what it has to say
Now I'm after that back highway
And the longest bridge I've ever crossed over Pontchartrain

Tu le ton temps that's what we say
We used to dance the night away
Me and my sister me and my brother
We used to walk down by the river

Mama lives in Mandeville
I can hardly wait until
I can hear my Zydeco
And laissez le bon ton roulet
And take rides in open cars
My brother knows where the best bars are
Let's see how these blues'll do
In the town where the good times stay

Tu le ton temps that's what we say
We used to dance the night away
Me and my sister me and my brother
We used to walk down by the river

Tu le ton temps that's what we say
We used to dance the night away
Me and my sister me and my brother

"I thought I saw a man brought to life
He was warm - he came around like
He was dignified
He showed me what it was to cry
Well you couldn't be that man I adored

What your heart is for
No I don't know him anymore

There's nothin' where we used to lie
Conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine

I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am chained
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed 
Into something real
I'm cold and I am shamed and bound
And broken on the floor 
And I can see the perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn

So I guess the fortune teller's right
I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins 
And now I don't care
I have no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch

There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what is goin' on
Nothin's right

I'm torn
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel

Illusion never changed
Into something real

I'm already torn",5

Tell me to save my tears

I've got it bad
And that ain't good

My poor heart is so sentimental
Not made of wood
I've got it so bad
And that ain't good

But when the fish are jumpin'
And Friday rolls around
My man an' I, we gin some
We pray some, and sin some

He don't love me like I love him
The way he should
I've got it bad
And that ain't good
Yes I've got it bad
And that ain't good",5
"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",6
"Somewhere waiting for me
There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever
Some day my prince will come
Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet
For my heart will start skipping a beat
Some day we'll say and do
Things we've been longing to
Though she's far away
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true",7
"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",6

Let your heart be light

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore

Gather near to us once more

And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",6
"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",7
"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",6
"Baltimore Oriole
Took one look at that mercury, forty below
No life for a lady
To be draggin' her feathers around in the snow
Leaving me blue, off she flew
To the Tangipaho-down Louisiana
Where a two-tiin' Jaybird
Met the divine Miss O

I'd like to ruffle his plumage
That Baltimore Oriole
Messed around with that big guy
Till he singed her wings
Forgivin' is easy-it's a woman like, now and then
Could happen to thing
Send her back home
Home ain't home without her warbling
How she can sing
Make a lonely man happy, Baltimore Oriole
Come down from that bough
Fly to your daddy now",6

"About a year ago - I heard this truly terrific, absolutely true story
And it just so happens that I told a couple of friends of mine this truly terrific, absolutely true story 
And it just so happens that these friends of mine are song writers
And guess what happened, right, truly terrific, absolutely true song

Gather around, I've got a story to tell, About a Manhattan lady that I know very well
She lives at five Riverside, her name is Shirley Devore, And she travelled 'round the world to meet the guy next door

Well there was trouble inside apartment 29 E, 'Cause Shirley's mother and dad were as upset as can be
They said we hate to complain dear and we don't like to grouse, But your nearly 32, you should get out of the house

You gotta ring them bells, you gotta ring them bells, You gotta make 'em sing and really ring them bells
It's such a happy thing to hear 'em ting-a-ling, You gotta ring - them - bells

Well Shirley was 31, which she was loathe to admit, And she had never been loved, which didn't thrill her a bit
And so she sat and she thought, she thought for hours on end, And said I'll go to Chase, Manhattan, where I got me a friend

And so she borrowed a thou' and called TWA, And told her mother and dad that she was up and away
I'm gonna travel the continent, a month, maybe two, And haul me home a hus' if it's the last thing I do

You gotta ring them bells, you gotta ring them bells, You gotta make 'em sing and really ring them bells
It's such a happy thing to hear 'em ting-a-ling, You gotta ring - them - bells

She met a Londoner first, but they did not hit it off, 'Cause every time she approached he got a bronchial cough
And so she went to Madrid and met a handsome Senior, But he liked to throw the bul",6
"Some people can get a thrill, knitting sweaters and sitting still
That's OK for some people don't know they're alive
Some people can thrive and bloom, living life in a living room
That's perfect for some people of one hundred and five
But I, at least gotta try

When I think of all the sights that I gotta see
And all the places I gotta play, All the things that I gotta be at
Come on papa, what'd ya say?

Some people can be content, playin' bingo and payin' rent
That's livin' for some people, for some hum-drum people, too be
But some people, ain't me

I had a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
All about June in the Orpheum circuit
Give me a chance, I know I can work it, Uhh, what a dream
And it was just as real as could be, papa
Well just listen to me, there I was in Mr Orpheum's office
And he was sayin' to me, Rose!
Get yourself some new orchestrations, new routines and red velvet curtains
Get a feathered hat for the baby, photographed in front of the theater
Get an agent and in jig time, you'll be being booked in the big time

Oh what a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
And all that I need is eighty-eight bucks, Papa, that's it
That's what he said papa, only eighty-eight bucks, papa

It's uh, yeah, but it's only eighty-eight bucks
It's not like I'm askin' for a second mortgage on this place
What do ya gettin' so crick, why you gettin' crazy, it's eighty-eight lousy bucks
What do you mean I ain't gettin' eighty-eight cents out of you
Well, I'll get it, and I'll get my kids, out, now

How to get you back in my life

And I'm prepared to take chances
I've told you how

Shout and raucous laughter
Sounds of breaking glass shatter through the night

Where the actors play, you kissed me every night

You'd soon be back to stay, and it would be alright

Got to get you back in my life

That do not do the thing they most do show,
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
Unmoved, cold and to temptation slow;

They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
And husband nature's riches from expense;
They are the lords and owners of their faces,
Others but stewards of their excellence.

The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
Though to itself it only live and die,
But if that flower with base infection meet,
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:

For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.""",5

For the fun that people had at night
Late at night don't need hostility
The timid smile, and pause to free
I don't care about their different thoughts
Different thoughts are good for me
Up in arms and chaste and whole
All God's children took their toll
Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
Half the people read the papers
Read them good and well
Pretty people, nervous people
People have got to sell
News you have to sell
Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety
Look, my eyes are just holograms
Look, your love has drawn red from my hands
In my hands you know you'll never be
More than twist in my sobriety

"Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people living life in peace, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope some day you'll join us
And the world will be as one",5
"Did you say, I've got a lot to learn
Well don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the ABC of it
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
If a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
Teach me tonight

I'll use that star to write ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky
One thing isn't very clear, my love
Should the teacher stand so near, my love

Graduation's almost here, my love
So would you teach me tonight
I must not fail, my love
Teach me tonight",7
"There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling
When you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold
You may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold
Let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men becau-ause
The butcher, the baker, the grocer and the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye
For anything theatrical and why, why-y?

There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
You get word before the show has started
That your father died inside of dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted
You're broken-hearted, but you go on

There's no people like show people
They smile when they are low
Yesterday they told you you would not go far
That night you open and there you are
Next day on your dressing room
They've hung a star
Let's go, on with the show",6
"Thank you very much, you're really terrific
And seeing how you are, can I tell ya something, I have a problem
No wait, it's not a big problem, but it is a problem
It's my name, you know I find that still - a lot of people call me Lisa - Wrong
My name is Liza - Liza - has a 'Z' in it
Well, for instance, somebody'll come up to me on the street and say
Hello Lisa how are you, I'll say, I'm fine thank you but it's Liza
Or somebody'll say - Lisa what a nice hat you have on
I'll say thank you very much but my name is Liza and that's my hair
So you can see what I mean
Anyway, I've been trying to figure out a final solution to this whole thing
And I think I've come up with the answer - Jack

It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza
I'll do it again
It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza

Now - if my name were Ada, I'd be Ada, even backwards I'd be Ada
Or if my name were Ruth, then I'd be Ruth because with Ruth what can you do
Or Sally, or Margaret or Ginger or Faye
But when you're a Liza you always have to say

Nn - It's Liza with 'Z' not Lisa with an 'S', 'Cause Lisa with an 'S' goes SSno'ZZ
It's 'Z' instead of 'S', 'Lie' instead of 'Lee', It's simple as can be, see, Liza

What d'ya say, old friend?
Are you okay, old friend?
Are we, are we unique?

Time goes by
Everything else keeps changing
You and I, we can
Continue next week, yeah

Most friends fade
Or they don't make the grade

"Chances are 'cause I wear a silly grin
The moment you come into view
Chances are you think that I'm in love with you

Just because my composure sort of slips
The moment that your lips meet mine
Chances are you think my heart's your Valentine

In the magic of moonlight when I sigh, ""Hold me close, dear""
Chances are you believe the stars that fill the skies are in my eyes

Guess you feel you'll always be the one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are your chances are awfully good

You and you alone

Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",7
"It had to be you, it had to be you;
I wandered around, and finally found - the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue;
And even be glad, just to be sad, thinking of you.

Some others I've seen, might never be mean;
Might never be cross, or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else, gave me a thrill - with all your faults, I love you still.
It had to be you, wonderful you;
It had to be you.",6
"Never let me go
Love me much too much
If you let me go
Life would lose its touch

What would I be without you?
There's no place for me without you

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day
Without you I know

Because of one caress my world was overturned
At the very start, all my bridges burned
By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

Never let me go
Never let me go

Never let me go
I'd be so lost if you went away
There'd be a thousand hours in the day

By my flaming heart you'd never leave me, would you?
You couldn't hurt me, could you?

You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours

And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",6

Wherever I go I know she goes.
No fits, no fights, no feuds
And no egos, Amigos, together!

Through thick and through thin,
All out or all in.
And whether it's win, place or show.
With you for me and me for you,
We'll muddle through whatever we do.
Together, wherever we go.

Wherever we go, whatever we do,
We're gonna go through it together.
Wherever we sleep, if prices are steep,
We'll always sleep cheaper together.

A duo
Whatever the row I hoe, you hoe.
A trio.
And any I. O. U., I owe you-oh's?
Who, me-oh? No, you-oh.
No, we-oh.
Together!

Including the cow,
Though business is lousy and slow.
With Herbie's vim, Louise's verve,
Now all we need is someone with nerve.
Together
Together
Wherever
Wherever
Together, wherever,
Together, wherever we go.

We go in a group,
We tour in a troupe.
We land in the soup, but we know
The things we do, we do by threes.
A perfect team.
No, this way, Louise!
Together
Together
Wherever
Wherever
Together, wherever we go!",6

Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms

In your heart, believe what in my heart I know
That forever more, I'll wait for you",7

Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

Love that's only slightly soiled

For a trip to paradise?

Let the poets pipe off love
In their childish way

Better far than they

You and me, you and me, you and me, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby
You and me, you and me, you and me, baby

We'll have a kid or maybe we'll rent one

Some nights we'll sit romancin'
Watchin' the late show by the fire

We'll play checkers all day 'til we pass away",5

I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
and though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I will meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still, I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

We'll build a little home
Just ment for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you

But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Now I'm fine at the start, 
Then stuck with a heart that is aching
How its breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

Somehow, I knew at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Oh I'm taking
I was fine at the start, 
Now I am stuck with a heart that is aching, breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love I'm in love with you",6

Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare, gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather, just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

When he went away, the blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray the Lord, above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on, all I have in life is gone
Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time

I walk around, heavy hearted and sad
Night comes around and I'm still feelin' bad
Rain pourin' down, blindin' every hope I had
This pitterin', patterin', beatin' and spatterin' drives me mad
Love, love, love, love, this misery is just too much for me

Can't go on, everything I had is gone
Stormy weather, since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time",5

When I make the rules
And rule number one
From here to the end
Is I am my own best friend

I am my own best friend
Baby's her own best friend

Who never said die
Are standing here this minute
Me, myself, and I

I'll pass every test
If life is a game
I'll play it the best
'Cause I won't give in
And I'll never bend
And I am my own - best friend",8

"In a small cafe on a crowded night
In a spot of light stands the singer
Then the band begins and the beat is strong
And the room belongs to the singer

All the people turn to hear her sad refrain
And catch the cry of pain that's in her song
But in her haunted face and in her searching eyes
There is a sign that something's wrong

Now the eager crowd hangs on every word
But the sounds are slurred by the singer
Til' the people feel every aching part 
Of the broken heart of the singer

Still the song goes on about a love she knew
That seemed so sure, so true, but turned out wrong
And from the tears she shows nobody really knows
Is she the singer or the song
Is she the singer or the song

As the sad song ends she hits the final note
It catches in her throat but comes out strong
And as she bows and goes, nobody really knows
Was she the singer or the song
Was she the singer, or, the, song...

La-la-lah-la-lah, la-la-lah-la-lah, la-la-lah-la-lah...

That's okay for some people don't know they're alive
Some people can thrive and bloom, living life in a living room

When I think of all the sights that I gotta see
And all the places I gotta play, All the things that I gotta be at
Come on papa, what'd'ya say?

Some people can be content, playin' bingo and payin' rent
That's livin' for some people, for some hum-drum people, to-oo be
But some people, ain't me

I had a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
All about June in the Orpheum circuit
Give me a chance, I know I can work it, uhh, what a dream
And it was just as real as could be, papa
Well just listen to me, there I was in Mr Orpheum's office
And he was sayin' to me, Rose!
Get yourself some new orchestrations, new routines and red velvet curtains
Get a feathered hat for the baby, photographed in front of the theater
Get an agent and in jig time, you'll be bein' booked in the big time

Oh what a dream, a wonderful dream, papa
And all that I need is eighty-eight bucks, Papa, that's it
That's what he said papa, only eighty-eight bucks, papa

It's uh, yeah, but it's only eighty-eight bucks
It's not like I'm askin' for a second mortgage on this place
What d'ya gettin so crick, why you gettin' crazy, it's eighty-eight lousy bucks
What do you mean I ain't gettin' eighty-eight cents outta you
Well, I'll get it, and I'll get my kids, out, now

Goodbye, to blueberry pies, good riddance to all the socials I had to go to
All the lodges that I had to play, all the Shriners I said hell",6
"[Chorus]
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)
Where is the love (where is the love)

Where is the love you said you'd give to me
Soon as you were free, will it ever be, where is the love

You told me that you didn't lo-ove her
And you were gonna say goodbye-ye-ye
But if you really didn't mea-ean it
Why did you have to lie, where is the love

[Chorus]

Where is the love you said was mine all mine
Till the end of time, was it just a lie, Where is the love

If you had had a sudden change of heart
I wish that you would tell me so-o-o
Don't leave me hangin' on to promises
You've got to let me know
Where is the love

Oh how I wish I'd never meet you
I guess it must have been my fa-a-ate
To fall in love with someone else's love
All I can do is wait

Oh where is the love, where is the love
Where is the love, where is the love
Where is the love",7
"The moment I saw him smile
I knew he was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
Though I dream of him all the while

But he doesn't know I exist
No matter how I may persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me
Though I live at fifty-one-thirty-five Kensington Avenue
And he lives at fifty-one-thirty-three

How can I ignore the boy next door
I love him more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me
Doesn't even tease me
And he never sees me glance his way

And though I'm heart-sore, the boy next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore him
So I can't ignore him
The boy next door

I just adore him
So I can't ignore him
The boy next door",6
"Dancing in the dark 'til the tune ends
We're dancing in the dark and it soon ends
We're waltzin' in the wonder of why we're here
Time hurries by, we're here and we're gone

Lookin' for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you love
An' we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark

What though love is old
What though song is old
Through them we can be young

Hear this heart of mine
Wailin' all the time
Dear one, tell me that we're one

Lookin' for the light of a new love
To brighten up the night, I have you love
An' we can face the music together
Dancing in the dark, dancing in the dark
Dancing in the dark",6

Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs

Look at what I've got:

I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man
Who could ask for anything more?
I've got daisies in green pastures
I've got my man

Old man trouble I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door

I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
Cause my heart belongs to Daddy

If I invite a some boy some night
To dine on my finnan haddie
It's just a pose, 'cause my baby knows
That my heart belongs to daddy

Yes my heart belongs to Daddy
So I simply couldn't be bad
Yes I'm gonna marry daddy
So I want to warn you, laddie

Gee but I think you are swell
But my heart belongs to daddy

My daddy treats it so well",3
"Here I go again, I hear those trumpets blow again.
All aglow again, takin' a chance on love.
Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",7
"Thank heaven for little girls
For little girls get bigger every day!

Thank heaven for little girls
They grow up in the most delightful way!

Those little eyes so helpless and appealing
One day will flash and send you crashin' through the ceilin'

Thank heaven for little girls
Thank heaven for them all,
No matter where no matter who
For without them, what would little boys do?

Thank heaven, thank heaven 
Thank heaven for little girls!",5
"A clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean.
That's entertainment!
The lights on the lady in tights
Or he bride with the guy by her side
Or the ball where she gives it her all.
That's entertainment!
The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorcee who is after her ex
It could be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his father and causes lots of bother.
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!
It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet, and everyone ends in mincemeat.
The guy who was waving the flag
That began with the mystical hand
Hip hooray! The American way
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!",6
"What did I have that I don't have?
What did he like that I lost track of?
What did I do that I don't do the way I did before?

What isn't there that once was there?
What have I got a great big lack of?
Something in me that he could see
That beckons to him no more

Oh, I'm just a victim of time
Obsolete in my prime
Out of date and outclassed, by my past

What did he love that there's none of?
What did I lose the sweet warm knack of?
Wouldn't I be the late great me, if I knew how?
What did I have I don't have now?

What did he see that's gone in me?
What did I use that now I'm shy of?
Why is the sequel never the equal?
Why is there no encore?

Where can I go to repair?
All the wear and the tear
'Till I'm once again the previous me

What did he like that I am not like?
What was the charm that I've run dry of?
What would I give if my old know how
Still knew how?

What did I have I don't have now?
What did he love that there's none of?
What did I have I don't have now?",6
"Come Saturday morning
I'm goin' away with my friend
We'll Saturday-spend till the end of the day
Just I and my friend

We'll travel for miles in our Saturday smiles
And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone

You know what the trouble is?
Trouble is that probably all the good things in life
Take place in no more than a minute

I mean all I did, I, I bet you
At the end of seventy years should you lose someone
You can sit down, you can figure the whole thing out

You spent nineteen years sleepin'
You spent five years goin' to the bathroom
You spent thirty-five years doin'
Some kinda work you absolutely hated

Spent seven thousand eight hundred and
Fifty-three minutes blinkin' your eyes
And added to that, you got that one minute of good things
Then one day you wonder whether you're minute's up

And then we'll move on
But we will remember long after Saturday's gone",5
"It starts with one thing
I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try,
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme,
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter",5
"Sometimes you're happy
And sometimes you're sad
But the world goes round
And sometimes you lose
Every nickel you had
But the world goes round
Sometimes you're dreams get broken in pieces
But that doesn't matter at all
Take it from me, there's still going to be
A summer, a winter, a spring and a fall
And sometimes a friend starts treating you bad
But the world goes round
And sometimes your heart breaks
With a deafing sound
Somebody loses, and somebody wins
And one day it's kicks
And it's kicks in the shins
But the plant spins
And world goes round and round
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes your sad
But the world goes round
And sometimes you lose
Every nickel you had
But the world goes round
Sometimes your dreams get broken in pieces
But that shouldn't altar a thing
Take it from me, there's till going to be
A summer, a winter, a fall and a spring
And sometimes a friend starts treating you bad
But the world goes round
And sometimes your heart breaks
With a deafing sound
Somebody loses, and somebody wins
And one day it's kicks then it's kicks in the shins
But the planet spins
And the world goes round
And round and round and round and round
The world goes round
And round
And round
And round",4

Swimming in the Rhine,

"You see this girl, this girl's in love with you
Yes I'm in love who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell it know each other very well

How can I show you I'm glad I got to know you 'cause
I've heard some talk they say you think I'm fine
This girl's in love and what I'd do to make you mine
Tell me now is it so don't let me be the last to know

My hands are shakin' don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause
I need your love, I want your love
Say you're in love and you'll be my guy, if not I'll just die

Tell me now is it so don't let me be the last to know
My hands are shakin' don't let my heart keep breaking 'cause
I need your love, I want your love

"At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

Oh yeah, yeah
At last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, yeah

You smile, you smile
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven
For you are mine at last

I found a dream, that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah, yeah

You smile, you smile
Oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in heaven

At last
At last",6
"I never kissed a man before
Oh, isn't that a shame?
I never kissed a man before,
Before I knew his name

I never had a taste for wine
Oh, isn't that a sin?
I never had a taste for wine
For wine can't compare with gin

It's nice as nice can be
My faith is at last restored
To find that vice can be
Its own reward

I always go to bed at ten
Oh, isn't that a bore?
I always go to bed at ten
And then, I go home at four",7
"I'm so unhappy, left all alone ain't got nobody to love now
The man I long for is not strong for me
He's not an angel, but I don't care, perhaps a change'll come some day,
Whatever he is I want to be his way.

Don't want my mammy, I don't need a friend, 
my heart is broken, it won't ever mend,
I ain't much carin' just where I will end, I must have that man 
I'm like an oven that's cryin' for heat, 
He treats me awful each time that we meet
It's just unlawful how that boy can cheat, 
But I must have that man! 
He's hot as Hades, 
a lady's not safe in his arms when she's kissed
But I'm afraid that he's cooled off and maybe I'm ruled off his list, 
I'll never be missed

I need that person much worse and just bad I'm half alive and he's drivin' me mad,
He's only human, if he's to be had 
I must have that man",4
"Moments like this make me thrill through and through
Careless moments like this close to you
Nonchalantly we'd dine and we'd dance
Yet my heart seems to melt in your grace

Sweet moments like this with the soft lights aglow
Make me long for your kiss though I know
I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares

I'd be just one of all your affairs
But at moments like this, who cares.",5
"Remind me not to find you so attractive
Remind me that the world is full of men
When I start to miss you, to touch your hand, to kiss you
Remind me to count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

Not to mention that I love you

To be sorry that we met
Although I adore you, remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret
So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me
Don't let me kiss you, please remind me
Unless, my darling, you forget",5
"Maybe it was the music, or the glamorous sky of blue.
Maybe it was the mood I was in or maybe it was really you, really you.

This heart of mine was doing very well.
The world was fine as far as I could tell.
And then quite suddenly I saw you, and I dreamed of gay amor.
At dawn I'll wake up singing sentimental overtures.

This heart of mine is gayly dancing now.
I taste the wine of real romancing now.
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design.
As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.

As long as life endures, it's yours this heart of mine.",6
"I have a feeling that beneath the little halo on your noble head
There lies a thought or two the devil might be interested to know
You're like the finish of a novel that I'll finally have to take to bed
You fascinate me so

I feel like Christopher Columbus when I'm near enough to contemplate
The sweet geography descending from your eyebrow to your toe
The possibilities are more than I can possibly enumerate
That's why you fascinate me so

So sermonize and preach to me
Make your sanctimonious little speech to me
But oh my darling you forgive my inability to concentrate
I think I'm dealing with a powder keg that's just about to blow
Will the end result deflate me, or will you annihilate me
You fascinate me so

So sermonize and preach to me
Make your sanctimonious little speech to me
But oh my darling you forgive my inability to concentrate
I think I'm dealing with a powder keg that's just about to blow
Will the end result deflate me, or will you annihilate me
You aggravate me
You irritate me
You fascinate me so",6
"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",5
"Why can't you behave?
Oh, why can't you behave?
After all the things you told me,
And the promises that you gave,
Oh, why can't you behave?

Why, why, why can't you be good?

I was faithful and true but what good will it do

And do, do just as you should?

Yes you had the right touch but I was askin' too much
Won't you turn that new leaf over,
So your baby can be your slave?
Oh, why can't you behave?

There's a farm I know near my old home town,
Where we two can go and try settling down.
There I'll care for you forever,
'Cause you're all in this world I crave.
Oh, why can't you behave?
Why can't you behave?",6
"Dream of a land my soul is from 
I hear a hand stroke on a drum 

Elegant boy 
Beautiful girl 
Dancing for joy
Delicate whirl
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Two young lovers dance face to face
With undulating grace
They gently sway
Then slip away
To some secluded place

Whispering trees
Echo their sighs
Passionate pleas
Tender replies
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as a night
Afro blue

Lovers on flight
Upward they glide
Burst at the height
Slowly subside

And my slumbering fantasy assumes reality
Until it seems it?s not a dream
The two are you and me
Shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

Oh shades of delight
Cocoa hue
Rich as the night
Afro blue

"Are you frightened by the fire in my eyes
It burns for you
And I know you see it too
Your heart was open looking for light
Are you surprised
Baby leave your pride

[Chorus]
Cause I'm gonna burn, right or wrong
It's all for you to see
Stop hiding your eyes
Take the fire from me
And be warm, life is hard
And sometimes the night is long
Take the fire
You don't have to give it back to me

It's a gift to feel this good
Loving you is enough to bring me peace
Nothing's perfect
But it's enough
To fill with love
A heart that was cold with dust

[Chorus]

Don't worry about me
I'll stand here in the darkness
With the joy that heaven promised
To those who live
With open hearts

[Chorus]",6
"In the city made of stone
I hear the sirens moan
I can't escape the beating question:
Where do I belong?

The boundary lines lie before me
I cross into the unknown
I try to leave my fears behind me,
Try to carry on

[Chorus]
Ev'ry day sing a song of grace
We've come this far by grace
And when you pray to find your place:
Love will lead the way!

In the shadows of the valley
Tears mingle with rain
A shining light will break my darkness
And mercy will remain

Bless the seven souls who raised me
Back in Georgia state
And tell my loved-ones not to worry
But love will conquer hate

[Chorus]",5
"[Chorus:]
Never be afraid to love
Never be afraid to just be
Catch the way & change the doubt
Have a courage to be free
Don't gad your eyes with others lies
See only what You wanna? see
Duplicate the simple truth
Have a courage to be free

Open Your eyes, you can fly
Open Your eyes, you can fly
You can fly
You can fly

Open Your eyes, you can fly
Open Your eyes, you can fly
You can fly
You can fly

Oooooo, mhmmm hey eh he

You can fly ,yeah

"There is a feeling here in side
That I cannot hide
And I know I've tried, but it's me turning me around

I'm not sure if I'm aware
If I'm up or down
Or here or there
I need both feed on the ground

Maybe I'm just going crazy
I let my self get up tide

I'm acting just like a baby
But I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be alright

Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home

In a different place
In a different time
Different people all all round me

I would like to know there different world
And how different they find me

And just what's a wiss
Is it big and will it scare me
If I ask to leave will the wiss even hears me
And how will I Knew then - if I ever get home again

Here I am alone
Witch feels the same
I don't know just where I'm going

Out here on my own and it's not a game
And a strange wind is blowing
I'm so amazed and the things that I see here

No I don't want to be afraid
I just no want to be here

In my mind this is clear
What am I doing here

I wish I was home
I wish I was home",5
"Cold winds may blow
Over icy seas
I'll take with me
The warmth

A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter
Than wine

I'll leave behind
My heart to wear
And may it ever
Remind you of

A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter
Than wine

I will return
I will return
I'll come back
For the honey
And you

He never came back
To his love so fair
And so she died
Dreaming of his kiss

His kiss was honey
A taste more bitter
Than wine

I will return
I'll come back
I'll come back

I will return",5
"So you roam, and you roam
You say that no place is your home.
So I will roam too

I don't wanna stay, without you.
There's nothing here, nothing here.
It's time for me to disappear if love won't come through.

I don't wanna stay without you.

And I know, any place I go, all I see,
All I see, is you there in front of me
Do dreams ever come true.
I don't wanna stay without you

I don't wanna stay without you.
I don't wanna stay without you.

I don't wanna be without you
Oooh
Don't leave me.
I wanna be where you are.",7
"Narrow daylight entered my room
Shining hours were brief
Winter is over
Summer is near
Are we stronger than we believe?

I walked through halls of reputation
Among the infamous too
As the camera clings to the common thread
Beyond all vanity
Into a gaze to shoot you through

Is the kindness we count upon
Hidden in everyone?

I stepped out in a sunlit grove
Although deep down I wished it would rain
Washing away all the sadness and tears
That will never fall so heavily again

Is the kindness we count upon
Is hidden in everyone

I stood there in the salt spray air
Felt wind sweeping over my face
I ran up through the rocks to the old
Wooden cross
It's a place where I can find some peace

Narrow daylight entered my room
Shining hours were brief
Winter is over
Summer is near
Are we stronger than we believe?",5
"Your love is eternal, I never should have touched you
Broken words fill my mouth 'cause I never said goodbye

But what does it matter, who really cares
In this river of faces, in this new windy place
I will lose all your traces, I'll go and find another angel

One more word and I would have followed you
From behind my silent door I've been waiting, ready to go

But what does it matter, who really cares
In this river of faces, in this new windy place
I will lose all your traces, I'll go and find another

No one can stop me, I'm gonna run till I get free
'Cause I can wait until you're gone from me, hmm

So what does it matter, who really cares
In this river of faces, in this new windy place
I will lose all your traces, I'll go and find another angel

Hmmm, another angel",6
"Coming home to your shelter
Coming home where I stay

I go down in your water and I won't turn away
Coming back to your calling
I can hear your voice say

Coming home for tomorrow from my dreams of yesterday

You may not understand me but I hear you so well
Your voice comes in the cold wind, a tune I know so well

I can see you through any darkness
Your light it leads me on

I'm coming back to your orchard
Coming back to my home

People ask me where are you going, and I know I know what they think
I get tired, tired of their questions so I must find a way

To meet you down at the old grounds ,where we used to pray

I'm coming home for tomorrow from my dreams of yesterday",4
"[Chorus: 1]
Hey mann what you doing here
I don't remember letting you in

[Chorus: 2]
Hey mann how'd you get in here

I always took pride in my self-control
To my heart only I had the key

But somethings gone wrong with my radar screen
You slipped by and you captured me

[Chorus: 1]

[Chorus: 2]

I've done all I could to keep my head clear
Logic tells me that this should never be

But there's no mistaking the shape I'm in
Love has filled my every waking day

[Chorus: 2]

Now hear, here's the strangest thing
The day has come I thought I'd never see

I walk smiling in a light-glow and I'm calling out your name
I've lost the battle and I'm quiet well pleased

Hey mann how'd you get in here
You're in my heart

You're in my heart",6

"You wanna go back, well I'd rather not
Gave you all I had, gave you all I got to give

You had my time, trusted my soul
But it'll be the same play, till I grow old

[Chorus]
I want to get higher but you made me low
You made me wonder which way to go
It could have been good, instead it was wrong
All I want from you, is leave me standing alone

I had to run away, I had to get free
Find my own life, for me to be me

So if you're feeling wry, if you're feeling lost
Don't look to me to help you pay the cost

[Chorus]

Just leave me, leave me, leave me standing alone
Yeah yea
Go on leave me, leave me, just leave me standing alone
Yeah yea

Go take your road, the one you know
And don't worry 'bout me, or the way I go

When you get home, and you walk free
Just look up, you're gonna find me

Yeah just leave me, leave me, leave me standing alone
Yeah yea
Go on leave me, leave me, leave me standing alone
Yeah yea
Go on leave me, leave me, leave me standing alone

Tell me I can come over

I'll take these bad dreams and I'll drove along the way

I can feel the waves coming there, heavy and black

But I can't turn away now 'cause I
They're singin' a song

And I, I'm in harmony
I'm singing along

And what you did to me I, I can't take no more
I'll take these bad dreams and I'll lay them at the shore

The end of the ocean I'll never see
I stare out in the distance and it's looking back at me

And I'll look down to the water all night long
And I'll put my feet in, all night long

And I'll put my dreams in, all night long
And I'll put my tears in, all night long

What makes you think I ain't afraid

I won't go down if you say no
Just open up your mouth and say it baby

How you stopped needing me
When she came along

Oh how strange

Strange, you changed like night and day
Just up and walked away
When she came along

To think I thought you really loved me, but look what thoughts can bring

Strange, you're still in all my dreams
Oh what a funny thing
I still care for you

Well I guess I was just your puppet you held on a string

Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

From Florida to the North Pole.

Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",6
"Everybody looks away, nobody wants to tell me what's really going on
I wanna ask, I really wanna know, 'cause they gotta be all wrong
I know he loves me
He says he loves me
He would never lie to me

You never know till you see it
Don't believe it
Can't be happening to you
You heard the whispers, heard the rumors
Nothing hits you like the truth
There he is with her tonight
Seein' is believin'
Seein' is believin'

I wanna run away, I wanna cry, I wanna scream
Until the stars fall from the sky
I wish that it would go away
I wish that it was yesterday 
Or I could close my eyes
He's holding her
She's kissing him
Can't let them see me cry

It's like a slap in the face
It's like I've been erased
It's like it never meant nothin' at all

It's like a slap in the face
It's like I've been erased
It's like it never meant nothin' at all",5
"Large fingers pushin' paint... 
You're God and you got big hands... 
The colors blend... 
The challenges you give man... 
Seek my part...devote myself... 
My small self...like a book amongst the many on a shelf... 
Sometimes I know  sometimes I rise 
Sometimes I fall  sometimes I don't 
Sometimes I cringe  sometimes I live 
Sometimes I walk  sometimes I kneel 
Sometimes I speak of nothing at all... 
Sometimes I reach to myself, hear God...",6
"Don't you send for the doctor 'cause I'm dyin' the blues
I got nothin' to live for and nothin' to lose

And I know in my mind, in my heart
That we live two worlds apart
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

Don't you call for the doctor 'cause I'm cryin' in shame
I got no excuses 'cause I'm the one to blame

And I know in my heart it's all up to you
To give me the chance that I gave to you
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

Don't you call for the doctor 'cause I'm cryin' in shame
I got no excuses 'cause I'm the one to blame

That we live two worlds apart
And I know in my mind I can't bear
To lose all the things that we share

You gotta know in your heart, it's all up to you
Would you please give me the chance that I gave to you",6
"The walls are thin, the voices echo through her silent room
A door slams shut, the shouting follows soon
Those deafening familiar screams
Alcoholic haze, lipstick trace a place where lights are low
While mother can't pretend she doesn't know
Hearing all the retread lies
Banning all the reasons why
Bloody Mary, can't find her way home
Bloody Mary, can't do what she's told
Bloody Mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here
It's just not clear....	
Run away, no one cares if you live or why
Lie on your back and watch the virgin die
Daddy's little girl is gone forever more
Banging on a stone cold door
Bloody Mary, can't find her way home
Bloody Mary, can't  do  what she's told
Bloody Mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here
It's just not clear....	
Razor blades, cut deep into the wrist of emptiness
In a suicidal rage of attentions missed
No one knew you didn't know yourself
Still no one heard your cry for help
Bloody Mary, can't find her way home
Bloody Mary, can't  do  what she's told
Bloody Mary, always on hold
Something's going on around here
Bloody Mary, we didn't want you anyway
Bloody Mary, we didn't ever know what to say
Bloody Mary, won't you please go away
Something's going on around here
Something's going on around here
Something's going on around here...

"Here comes a candle to light you to bed
Here comes a chopper to chop off your head
No strings attached, no lies are told
No bonds are broke and no dreams are sold

So blind we can't see
Got no power of will
(Yeah love kills)

[Chorus:]
Love kills all that it touches
Love kills us all
Love kills the life that it clutches
Love takes the fall

Penetrating like cancer it feeds
Parasite sucking life for it's needs
Seeping through you with venomous bliss
Until all lie defenseless, a kiss

So numb we can't feel
Malignant, never will you heal
(Yeah love kills)

[Chorus]

Just when you least expect, love strikes from behind
Creeping up on you, no warning, no sign
No turning back when you follow the danger
Never trust a stranger

[Chorus x2]",6
"I know what's going through your mind
You think we'll be together for all time
I'm not just playing with your head
Cause I'm not for sale, but I'm yours to rent

You're over your head
I won't play hide and go seek under the bed

'Cause you're dead serious
You're dead serious

Watching my hawk eyes, I've been patrolled
Release claws dug so deep let me go
You'd rather see me dead than set me free
You'd lock me up and throw away the key

Green eyes on fire
I won't play misty for your jealous desires

Under the sheets, down below your means
Is where I love to be your only
Tear down the satins, unveil the lace
But you say...
I couldn't bear another someone's trace

I'd scratch her eyes out of her head
And you would wish that you were dead

You're over your head
I won't play hide and go seek under the bed

'Cause you're dead serious
You're dead serious",4
"When you were young
And your heart was an open book
You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
You know you did
You know you did
You know you did
But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die",6
"It's just me
Against the world

Leave me alone
I'm on the defense
I'm not made of stone
Why doesn't that ever make sense
I'm sick of all this indecision
You're messing with my mind
This ain't no false facade
And this ain't no freak disguise

'Cause I am for real
You don't know what I feel
My strength is in my will
I can not wait
I won't be second rate
In for the kill

[Chorus]
Its me against the world
Me against the world
Its me against the world
Me against the world
Its me against the world
Me against the world
Its me against the world
Me against the world

Inside looking outside
Through a goldfish bowl
In each hand of the masters
Make me lose control
If I'm an outcast 
I'm not the last
I'm gonna have my say
They'll never take me in alive
I'm gonna make em all pay

'Cause I am for real
You don't know what I feel
My strength is in my will
I can not wait
I won't be second rate
In for the kill

[Chorus]

You can't face my life
You just won't think twice
I see it my way
I won't be the martyr
I know you see it wrong
The color don't belong
I'm holding tight
Don't you push me too far

Yeah
Its me against the world
Its me against the world
Its me against the world
Don't you push me too far
Yeah
Its me against the world

Don't push me too far",5
"I call she says
I know you're there
I can hear you breathing
It's you again
I know it's wrong
My time is gone
I can feel your touch
Right through the phone

I got your number from the TV screen
Said if you're lonely just give me a call
'cause I'm only a hotline away
We got the girls so hot and sweet
The cherry filled here your talk is cheap
We'll bring your lonely nights to life

I feel your fingers touching me
Through my line
You seem to say all the right things
In time

Love is a crime
It's stealing my soul and my mind
Love is a crime
You get what you get love is blind

[Lead Break]

Love is a crime
It's stealing my soul and my mind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
You get what you get love is blind

They say I can't love girls like you
But what do they know
Leave that trash alone
I know you're more than just a voice on the phone

Your words they leave nothing to hide
On my line
I need to hear your voice inside
My line

Love is a crime
It's stealing control of my mind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
You want and you watch you can't find
Love is a crime
Love gives on the take from behind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
Behind the line she's all mine

Love is a love is a love is a love is a crime
Love is a crime
Love is a crime
Love is a crime

I'm praying and I know who's the same
I'm studying to become somebody else

I'm so mixed up, I'm out of luck, my god
I want to believe in you, I want to believe in you
I can't fight my moment of doubt
I want to believe in you, I can't see deceit in you
I can't see the truth through the lies
Confession, I told you all my secret obsessions
Now I need you even more
I want to believe in you, I want to believe in you
I know you won't let me down
I want to believe in you, I get confused am I through
Trusting you to be around
And even after midnight I can feel you fade away
Oh my love is strong, my faith has gone astray
And even when you're not here, I fall down and I pray
And even after midnight I can feel you slip away
All your love is gone, my soul has lost the way
And even when you're not here, I still want you anyway

Alcohol and razor blades and poison and needles 
Kindergarten people, they use them, they need them

There wasn't a way down on Earth here to cool them

At Kresge's and Woolworth's 
But decadent brains were at work to destroy 
Brats in batallions were ruling the streets 
Saying generation landslide 
Closed the gap between them 
And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies 
Who never conceived of us billion dollar babies 
Militant mothers hiding in their basements 
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets 
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high chairs 
While Mother's Lib burned birth certificate papers 
Dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer 
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance 
Sister's out till five doing banker's son's hours 
But she owns a Maserati that's a gift from his father 
Stopped at full speed at one hundred miles per hour 
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em

"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",5

Should I take the time to try,
For who else could qualify
After you, who?
Hold my hand and swear
You'll never cease to care,
For without you there what could I do?
I could search years
But who else could change my tears
Into laughter after you?",6
"When love comes in and take you for a spin
Oo la la la, c'est magnifique
When every night your loved one holds you tight
Oo la la la, c'est magnifique
But when, one day, your loved one drifts away
Oo la la la, it's so tragique
But when, once more, she whispers, ""Je t'a dore""
C'est magnifique",7
"When day is gone and night comes on
Until the dawn what do I do?
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
Dream dancing with you

We dance between a sky serene
And fields of green sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time
Dream dancing with you

Dream dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through

So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career
Dream dancing, dream dancing with you

When day is gone and night comes on
Until the dawn what do I do?
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
Dream dancing with you

We dance between a sky serene

Holding you, clutching you
All the night through

With you, with you, with you",7
"Without love, I am half human
Without love, I'm more machine
Without love, there's nothing doin'
I will die without love

Without love I am an island
All by myself in a heartbreak sea
Without love there's no denying
I am dying without love

Oh there is nowhere I can run
And there is no hiding place
Sticking out like a sore thumb
By the gloomy look upon my face

Without love I'm incomplete
Without love, I am not whole
Without love, I'm barely on my feet
I am dying without love

"We meet and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard
You speak and the angels sing
Or am I reading music into every word?

Suddenly the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore 
Then suddenly I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart",5
"Everything is set, skies are blue,
Can't believe it yet, but it's true, 
I'll give you just one guess, 
My sweet Lorraine said ""yes""
Waiting for the time, soon to be, 
When the bells will chime merrily,
 
(I'm so happy,) when it's raining I don't miss the sun, 
For it's in my sweeties smile,
Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

"Did you say that I've got a lot to learn?
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn
Teach me tonight

Starting with the A-B-C of it
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Teachers shouldn't stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
You'd better teach me tonight

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two
And I've also met a chick or two
But I still can learn a trick or two
Hey, teach me tonight

I who thought I knew the score of it
Kind of think I should know much more of it
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it
Hey, teach me tonight

The midnight hours come slowly creeping
When there's no one there but you
There must be more to life than sleeping
Single in a bed for two

What I need most is post graduate
What I feel is hard to articulate
If you want me to matriculate
You'd better teach me tonight

What do you get for lessons?
Teach me, come on and teach me
Teach me tonight",6

Make me spring in the snow

It's best that we do
Here's a kiss; I hope that this brings lots of luck to you

"Some other spring
I'll try to love
Now I still cling
To faded blossoms
Fresh from worn
Left crushed and torn
Like the love affair I mourn

Some other spring
When twilight falls
Will the night bring
Another to me?

Not your kind
But let me find
It's not true that love is blind
Sunshine's around me 
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story unfold twice?

Some other spring
Will my heart awake?
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
Love in some other spring?
Spring?",6
"What can I say to you, Bonita, what magic word would capture you
Like a soft salacious mist you are, Bonita, you fly away when love is new
What do you ask of me, Bonita, what part do you want me to play,
Shall I be the clown for you, Bonita, I will be anything you say.
Bonita, don't run away, Bonita.

Bonita, don't be afraid to fall in love with me,
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you, Bonita.
If you love me, life would be beautiful, Bonita.
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you.

Where do they go? Oh, I don't know, don't know
Wind that speaks to the leaves, telling stories that no one believes
Stories of love belong to you and to me

Oh, Dindi, if I only had words I would say all the beautiful
Things that I see when you're with me, oh, my Dindi
Oh, Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees, that's how my heart is
Singing Dindi, happy Dindi, when you're with me

I love you more each day; yes, I do; yes, I do
I'd let you go away if you take me with you

Don't you know, Dindi, I'd be running and searching for you

That would be me without you, my Dindi
Can't find the sea
That would be me without you, Dindi

That would be me without you, my Dindi",7
"Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely

I must have seemed
When she told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence?
What was I to say?
What can you say when a love affair is over?

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look
Why she must have asked
Did I just stare in icy silence?
What was I to do?
What can one do when a love affair is over?",5
"Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us.

Quiet thoughts and dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams,
And a window on the mountains and the sea - how lovely!

This is where I want to be, here, with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember.

I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter, tragic joke have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my love.",5
"Sad is to live in solitude
Far from your tranquil altitude
Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream
That never can be, will never be
Dreamer awake, wake up and see

Your beauty is an aeroplane
So high my heart can't bear the strain
A heart that stops when you pass by
Only to cause me pain
Sad is to live in solitude",5

I wonder who
I wonder who she can be;

Somebody loves me
I wish I knew,
Who can she be worries me

For every girl who passes me
I shout, hey! maybe,
You were meant to be my loving baby;

Somebody loves me
I wonder who,
Maybe it's you.",8
"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Guys talk ""girl talk"", it happens everywhere

Our summer day withers away too soon, too soon
Speak low when you speak, love
Our moment is swift; like ships adrift, we're swept apart too soon

Speak low, darling, speak low
Love is a spark lost in the dark too soon, too soon
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here and always too soon

Time is so old and love so brief
Love is pure gold and time a thief

We're late, darling, we're late
The curtain descends, everything ends too soon, too soon
I wait, darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me? Speak love to me and soon

"I feel the autumn breeze; it steals cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp and in its song
There is sadness because there's no you

The lonely autumn trees, how softly they're sighing
'Cause summer is dying; they know that in my heart
There's no gladness because there's no you

The park that we walked in, the garden we talked in
How lonesome they seem in the fall
The stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall

In spring we'll meet again; we'll kiss and recapture 
The summertime rapture we knew and from that day
Never more will I say, ""There's no you""

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long.
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair

You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable,

Over the shadows and the rain

I'd give her everything that I've got
For a little girl who'd fall in love with me

I want a little girl; she may not look
Like the kind in a picture book
But if she can cook, she'll suit me to a T

She don't have to wave her hair
Or dress in fancy clothes
And I wouldn't even care if she don't wear silken hose

I want a little girl to call my own
There must be someone that's all alone
Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me

Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me
Just a little girl who'd suit me to a T

She don't have to wave her hair
Or dress in fancy clothes
And I wouldn't even care if she don't wear silken hose

I need a little girl, that certain kind
The kind you read about but never find
Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me
Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me",6
"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me",6
"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",6
"When the only sound in the empty street,
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop.

When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town.
That her smile becomes a smirk,
I go to work.

Love for sale,
Appetizing young love for sale.
Love that`s fresh and still unspoiled,
Love that`s only slightly soiled,

Love for sale.
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who`s prepared to pay the price,

For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
in their childish way,

I know every type of love
Better far than they.
If you want the thrill of love,
I`ve been through the mill of love;

Old love, new love
Every love but true love
Love for sale.

Appetising young love for sale.
If you want to buy my wares.
Follow me and climb the stairs
Love for sale.
Love for sale.",6
"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street

"Any old time you want me
I am yours for the asking, darling
Any old time you need me
I'll be there with love that's lasting, darling
All through the years we'll stand together
Sharing the tears and stormy weather
And the sunshine will be yours and mine
Any old time you're blue
You'll have our love to chase away the blues
And any old thing you do I'll see you through
So just remember that I am waiting, dear
If ever you want me, I'll be near
Any old time and any place where you may be",6
"My man don't love me
Treats me oh-so mean
My man he don't love me
Treats me awful mean
He's the lowest man
That I've ever seen

He wears high-trimmed pants
Stripes are really yellow
He wears high-trimmed pants
Stripes are really yellow

But when he starts in to love me
He's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Make you stay out all night long

Love will make you do things
That you know is wrong

But if you treat me right, baby
I'll stay home everyday
Just treat me right, baby
I'll stay home night and day

But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like the faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like the faucet
It turns off and on

Sometimes when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone",5
"You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Oh, it's too bad; oh, it's so sad
I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad; oh, it's so sad
That I'm in love with you
Oh, you love me, then you snub me
Oh, but what can I do
I'm so in love with you

Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues 'bout every night

"You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my
Brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew

And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that
You might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of
Yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature
Rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julies
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain
That this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to",5
"We're sitting out here on the runway
Waiting for the plane to leave
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay
Bear with me, please""

They gave us the usual hassle
""You can't take those guitars on board""
But the boys in the band just smiled
Heard it all before

And as they're starting to serve champagne
To the folks at the front of the plane
I can hear the engines roaring
We're on our way

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight

The movie reminds of my lady
As she waits, ""Where are those guys?""
Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky

And now the sun is beginning to rise
It's like looking down on Paradise
There's a ball of fire that's burning
Giving life

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight",5

Make it sentimental
Whatever you could suggest

Make it sweet and tender

Goin' 'round and 'round

Oh, heaven is in your eyes
While the wind is sobbing
Underneath the stars
Both our hearts are throbbing
Like two guitars

Love here in the starlit hour
Night whispering lullabies
Let me dream forever
Underneath the silvery skies

Will it be just as sweet again
The glamor, the glory that we know?
Will I find when we meet again
The glamor, the glory?s still a glow?

But tonight, let us forget tomorrow
Here under the midnight blue
Love will bloom and flower
In the starlit hour with you",7

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior

or two
A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling
Before you can count up
One, two, three. For

There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people, who
wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel together
We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",6

Wouldst kiss me pretty? wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me
Hear me holler, i choose a sweet Lollapaloosa in thee

Two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of, not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand",7

Can't you see
What love and romance have done to me?
I'm not the same as I used to be

Tragedy
Just seems to be the end of me
My happiness is misery
This is my last affair

Right from the start you took my love

Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again
Putting rain in my eyes, tears in my dreams

It's that sly old sun of a gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that rain, still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart

Suppose I didn't stay, ran away, wouldn't play
The devil, what a potion he would brew?
He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered I wouldn't know what to do

Might as well give up that fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song, I'm just gonna tag along
With that old devil called love

Till I'd be so bewildered I wouldn't know what to do
With that old devil called love

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies?
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",6

And now I'm falling for you;
You turned the tables on me

The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own.
But after thinking it over and over,
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me.",7

All through the night
I delight in your love

You and your love brings me ecstasy

I can dream

To be close to you

"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I`m with you once more, under the stars
And down by the shore, an orchestra`s playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
'Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don`t let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
'Till the stars that were there before return above you
'Till you whisper to me once more, darling, I love you

And we suddenly know What heaven we`re in
When they begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",5

You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean

To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance

How long, how how long, baby how long?",5
"Days can be sunny with never a sigh
Don't need what money can buy
Birds in the trees sing their dayful of songs
Why shouldn't we sing along
I'm chipper all the day
Happy with my lot
How do I get that way
Look at what I've got

I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man
Who could ask for anything more
I've got daisies in green pastures
I've got my man
Who could ask for anything more

Old man trouble I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door
I've got starlight
I've got sweet dreams
I've got my man
Who could ask for anything more

Ba ba da da da ah

Old man trouble, I don't mind him
You won't find him 'round my door

"Every time I look down on this timeless town
Whether blue or gray be her skies
Whether loud be her cheers or whether soft be her tears
More and more do I realize that

I love Paris in the springtime
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles

I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris
Why, oh, why do I love Paris?
Because my love is near

"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",6

See what you have done, Lord, Lord, Lord 
Made me love you, now your gal has come 
You made me love you, now your gal has come 

I'm goin' away, baby, I won't be back till fall, Lord, Lord, Lord 
Goin' away, baby, won't be back till fall 
If I find me a good man, won't be back at all 
I'm gonna buy me a pistol, just as long as I am tall, Lord, Lord, Lord 
Shoot my man, and catch a cannonball 
If he won't have me, he won't have no gal at all 

See See Rider, where did you stay last night? Lord, Lord, Lord 
Your shoes ain't buttoned and your clothes don't fit you right 
You didn't come home till the sun was shining bright",6
"No gal made has got a shade on sweet Georgia brown
Two left feet but oh-so neat has sweet Georgia brown
They all sigh and want to die for sweet Georgia brown
I'll tell you why; you know I don't lie much

It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town
Since she came, why it's a shame how she coos 'em down
Fellers she can't get are fellers she ain't met
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her
Sweet Georgia brown",6
"Gather 'round me, everybody
Gather 'round me while I preach some
Feel a sermon comin' on me
The topic will be sin
And that's what I'm agin
If you want to hear my story
Then settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewing
The attitude of doing right

You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister inbetween

You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
Have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene

To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale
Noah in the ark,
What did they do
Just when everything looked so dark? 
Man, they said, we better

"It`s the wonder of the world, It`s a rocket to the moon
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Here`s to my best romance, Here`s to my worst romance
Here`s to my first romance - ages ago
Here`s to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
Here`s to the boys who said ""No!""

Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let`s fight for love

Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!

It`s the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""Clare de Lune""
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berserk for love
Loafers even go to work for love

Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love
Just the same - hooray for love!",6
"Blow ill wind, blow away, find my love today
You're blowin' me no good, no good
Go ill wind, go away, skies are oh, so gray
Around my neighborhood and that's no good

You're only misleadin' the sunshine I'm needin'
Ain't that a shame
It's so hard to keep up with troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere, when loves to blame

So ill wind, blow away, find my love today
You're blowin' me no good, no good, no good",4
"We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be--let our hearts discover
I have a feeling; it's a feeling I'm concealing; I don't know why
It's just a mental, incidental, sentimental alibi
But I adore you, so strong for you
Why go on stalling? I am falling; love is calling; why be shy?

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it; let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?
Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it; still, we can try

To make a go of it
We might have been meant for each other
To be or not to be--let our hearts discover
Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Now is the time for it, while we are young
Let's fall in love",6
"I never traveled further north than old Van Courtland park
And never further south than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of Jersey City, but first let me remark
I saw it from the Empire State Solarium

But we've been putting nickels in the postal savings bank
And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin deluxe tour

Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant
But at present
Let's take a walk around the block

You're just the companion
I want at Grand Canyon
For throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have`ll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To London in may time
To Venice in play time
To Paris in time for a frock
To Boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block

In winter at Christmas
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in Caracas, on a jackass
We'll take a ride around the block

We'll keep to our promise
To visit St. Thomas
And then at Jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling
Still I am willing
Just now to walk around the block

Onward, to Cathay
Then to Mandalay
Boom on to Bangkok
P'are'aps Vladivostok

We'll send the folks cables
Accumulate labels
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock
But since we are flat in old Manhattan
Let's take a walk around the block",5
"Go on and sing my heart
You know it's spring my heart
So why not show it?

Pretend you're glad my heart
Although you're sad my heart
He mustn't know it

Remember, love is not an easy game
No two hearts ever beat quite the same

Go on and dance my heart
Our only chance my heart
Is to forget it

Should you despair my heart
He'll know we care my heart
And we'll regret it

If it's to be, we soon shall see
And if it's not to be,
No power on earth can make it so

Go on and sing my heart
For if you sing, he'll never know

Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it`s final inning,
Don`t know what happened
It`s all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you`ve been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.

But fools will be fools and where`s he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It`s lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.

The livelong night and day.

There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away . . .

"Open your window and take a deep sigh
Think about letting the rest of the world go fly a kite
Takin' it easy is easy as pie
And holdin' your hand is such a natural high

You sent flowers, we spent hours
We can be happy alone in a tent
Think of the money we'd save on rent

Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain

Oh, the dark days are done and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace

You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true, I love you",7

He's the best professor in all the land""

Listen to the pep that emerges from the middle
Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin
Oh, what music
The clarineter could not be better

Hear that strain
I don't know just what it is, but it's great
They simply ruin it
Look at 'em doin' it
Come, come, don't hesitate

"Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world
We're not too proud to cling together
We're strong as long as we're together

Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless nights were not in vain
For we're together
And what is there to fear together

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together, together, together
If we're alone together",7

When I was but three
Mama, who was clever
Remarking to me
If son when you're grown up
You want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up
If you take this advice

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh

Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes
And you'll only stop with top folks

Be a crack Jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash
A college education I should never propose
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown",7

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,

Does July need a sky of blue?
Would I miss you, would I?

The kiss that's waiting for you.

There'll be no peace on Earth Until this curse
Is wiped off from this love-mapped universe
Are we mice or are we men? Can't you see the light?
Come you fellow victims lets unite

Down with love, the flowers and rice and shoes
Down with love, the root of all midnight blues
Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that mood and wrap it in cellophane

Down with love, let's liquidate all its friends
Moon and June and roses and rainbows ends
Down with songs that mourn about night and day
Down with love, just take it away, away
Take it away, take it away

Give it back to the birds and the bees and the V and E's
Down with Eyes romantic and stupid
Down with signs, down with Cupid
Ruttle that stuff that duff

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

The British Museum had lost its charm

And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere.",5

Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

They do things they don't do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man who danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago

Chicago, Chica-are-are-are-are-ago
Free and easy town, brassy, breezy town
Chicago, Chica-are-are-go
Let me cool my heels ri-ight down at Marshall Field
Come and walk with me along the lake
To the drake Hollar and Hoot, all through the loop
Shout how-now to Mrs. O'Leary's cow
No she, she, life is peachy

Chicago, we'll meat at the pump room, Ambassador East
To say the least, on shish kabab
And breast of squad we will and get fleeced
Don't tell me sin is rampant and rife
Think of that man who danced with his wife

In Chicago, Chicago
I'm in this city
What a wonderful windy, time",7
"We're a couple of swells
We stop at the best hotels
But we prefer the country far away from the city smells

We're a couple of sports
The pride of the tennis courts
In June, July and August we look cute when we're dressed in shorts

The Vanderbilts have asked us up for tea
We don't know how to get there, no sirree
No sirree...
We would ride up the avenue
But we haven't got the price
We would skate up the avenue
But there isn't any ice
We would ride on a bicycle
But we haven't got a bike
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes we'll walk up the avenue
And to walk up the avenue's what we like

Wall Street bankers are we
With plenty of currency
We'd open up the safe but we forgot where we put the key

We're the favourite lads
Of girls in the picture ads
We'd like to tell who we kissed last night but we can't be cads

The Vanderbilts are waiting at the club
But how are we to get there, that's the rub
That's the rub
We would sail up the avenue
But we haven't got a yacht
We would ride up the avenue
But the horse we had was shot
We would go on a trolleycar
But we haven't got the fare
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes we'll walk up the avenue
And we'll walk up the avenue till we're there

We would swim up the avenue
But we haven't any lake
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes we'll walk up the avenue
Yes a walk up the avenue's what we'll take!",7
"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Jai Guru Deva, om.
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

"Mammy mine
Your little rollin' stone that rolled away
Strolled away
Mammy mine
Your rollin' stone is rollin' home today
There to stay
Just to see your smilin' face
Smile a welcome sign
When I'm in your fond embrace
Listen, Mammy mine...

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason Dixon Line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya
""Weep No More My Lady,"" sing that song again for me
And ""Old Black Joe"" just as though you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing ""The Swanee River""
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye-baby with a Dixie melody

Any time
I hear a mammy sing her babe to sleep
Slumber deep
That's the time
The shadows 'round my heart begin to creep
And I weep
Wonder why I went away
What a fool I've been
Take me back to yesterday
In your arms again...

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason Dixon Line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya
""Weep No More My Lady,"" sing that song again for me

A million baby kisses I'll deliver

"Day in, day out
The same old hoodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And, darling, I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips
And the pounding becomes
The ocean's roar
A thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out",6
"It's yourself
It's yourself
It's yourself

It's yourself I love, don't you know
More than anyone, more than me
When you want my love, don't you know
What you ? don't you see

If there's anything I've left to give
I'll give it to you
If there's any life I have to live
I'll live it for you

What's my happiness
What's my wealth
What's my everything
It's yourself

If there's anything I've left to give
I'll give it to you
If there's any life I've left to live
I'll live it for you

"Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more",5
"The party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up
The piper must be paid

The party's over, the candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right just being with him
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

The party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

It's all over, my friend",6
"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide
I could cross the burning desert
If I had you by my side
I could be a king, dear, uncrowned
Humble or poor, rich or renowned
There is nothing I couldn't do 
If I had you

"A journey to a star would not be very far
As long as I'm alone with you
Romantic as we are, a journey to a star
Could start before the dawn breaks through

You're right beside my heart
We're just about a kiss apart
And we could make a dream come true
A moment of your love would have the feeling of
A journey to a star with you

You're right beside my heart
We're just about a kiss apart
And we could make a dream come true
A moment of your love would have the feeling of
A journey to a star with you",6
"There's a little brown road windin' over the hill
To a little white cot by the sea
There's a little green gate
At whose trellis I wait
While two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me

There's a gray lock or two in the brown of the hair
There's some silver in mine too, I see
But in all the long years
When the clouds brought their tears
Those two eyes o' blue
Kept smilin' through at me

And if ever I'm left in this world all alone
I shall wait for my call patiently
For if Heaven be kind
I shall wait there to find
Those two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me",5
"There is no breeze to cool the flame of love
These words are all, but all so true of love
We're here together, the moon is half
Stardust is falling and so am I

Oh, what a night, there's magic in the air
So hold me tight and tell me that you care
For I'll always adore you, true as stars shine above
There is no breeze to cool the flame of love

Oh, what a night, there's magic in the air
So hold me tight and tell me that you care

"Maybe it was the music
Or the glamorous sky of blue
Maybe it was the mood I was in
Or maybe it was really you, really you

This heart of mine was doing very well
The world was fine as far as i could tell
And then quite suddenly i saw you, and i dreamed of gay amours
At dawn i wake up singing sentimental overtures

This heart of mine is gaily dancing now
I taste the wine of real romancing now
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design
As long as life endures, it's yours, this heart of mine",6
"I've been away from you a long time 
I never thought I'd miss you so 
Somehow I feel your love is real

I know that you 
Yearn for me too
Swanee, you're calling me

Swanee
How I love you, how I love you 
My dear old Swanee! 
I'd give the world to be among the folks in 
D-I-X-I
Even now my mammy's waiting for me 
Praying for me, down by the Swanee

The folks up north will see me no more 
When I go to the Swanee shore! 

Swanee! Swanee!
I'm coming back to Swanee 
Mammy, mammy
I love the old folks at home!

"No love, no nothin'.

I'm just about as solitary
As anyone could be
Of course my life is not so merry
But that's alright with me

No love, no nothin',
Until my baby comes home,
No sir! No nothin',
As long as baby must roam,
I promised him I'd wait for him
Till even Hades froze,
I'm lonesome, Heaven knows,
But what I said still goes,

No love, no nothin',
And that's a promise I'll keep,
No fun with no one,
I'm getting plenty of sleep
My heart's on strike
And though it's like an empty honeycomb,
No love, no sir! No nothin',
Till my baby comes home

My heart's on strike
And though it's like an empty honeycomb,
No love, no sir! No nothin',
Till my baby comes home

No Sir, I'm waiting
Till my baby comes home.",4
"Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
His truth is marching on

He has sounded for the trumpet that shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat
Oh, be swift, my soul to answer Him, be jubilant, my feet
Our God is marching on

Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
His truth is marching on

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me
As He died to make men holy let us die to make men free
While God is marching on

"Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams,
Funny, but here's that rainy day.
Here's that rainy day they told me about,
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way.

Oh, where's that worn out wish that I threw aside,
After it brought my lover near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day,
Funny, that rainy day is here.

Where's that worn out wish that I threw aside,
After it brought my lover near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day,
Funny, that rainy day is here.",6
"The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gray
The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care

My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me",5
"Little drops of rain, little grains of sand
Makes the mighty ocean and the pleasant land
Little notes that sing, little words that rhyme
Make the mighty memories and the dreams of time

Never let a minute lie there on the shelf
For there maybe in it all love's life itself
Little smiles of hope, little drops of tears
Make this thing [Incomprehensible], go dancing down the years

Little drops of rain, little rays of sun
Make the hope for rainbow, glow for everyone

"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue.",5

There's just a memory among my souvenirs

Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs

A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest

I count them all apart and as the teardrops start
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs

I count them all apart and as the teardrops start

Love can be insane
Love can be a life of sadness and pain

Love can be a summer shower
Love can be the sun
Love can be two hearts that flower as one

It can be, fine and free
But that kind
Is not so very easy to find

Love can be a dying ember
Love can be a flame
Love pledged in September
May be dead in December
You may not even remember it came

Love can be a joy forever
Or an empty name
Love is almost never ever the same

Love can be an evil-doer
Love can be a fog
Love can make you feel like you were a dog

Love can be a snow-capped mountain
Love can be the truth
Love can be an endless fountain of youth

It can be ecstasy
But it's true
It doesn't always happen to you

Love can be a four-score failure
Love can bring you fame
Love fresh as the morning
May be wild when it's 'borning
And then without any warning, it's tame

Oh love can be a sweet endeavor
Or a dirty shame
Love is almost never ever, the same!",7

You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart

Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody

'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through and through
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart

Out of town were the people I knew 
I had that feeling of self-pity

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town 
Had me low and had me down 
I viewed the morning with alarm 
The British Museum had lost its charm

For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town 
The sun was shining everywhere.",5

Ding dong! The bells are gonna chime.
Pull out the stopper!

Roll up the floor.
If I am whistlin'

Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.

Drug me or jail me,
Stamp me and mail me.

But get me to the church on time!
I gotta be there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin' in me prime.

Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table,

And get em to the church on time!

If I am flying
Then shoot me down.
If I am wooin',
Get her out of town!

For I'm getting married in the morning!
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.

Feather and tar me;
Call out the Army;
But get me to the church.

Get me to the church

For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!

Starlight is reelin' home to bed now.
Mornin' is smearin' up the sky.
London is wakin'.
Daylight is breakin'.
Good luck, old chum,
Good health, goodbye.

I'm gettin' married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime
Hail and salute me
Then haul off and boot me
And get me to the church,
Get me to the church

"Did y'ever wake up in the morning
And grumble as you tumble out of bed?
You stub your toe, ouch!
You hit your elbow, ooh!
You bump your head, oh!
You step on a tack and you let out a howl,
There's soap in your eyes and you can't find the towel!
You try to comb your hair but can't arrange it,
Spill orange juice on your dress and have to change it!
Then all day long,
Everything you touch goes wrong!

Teacher told us, when this happens, never to whine or wail;
The same thing happens in life, but on a much larger scale!

It never rains but what it pours;
If lady luck should happen to desert you,
A bit of rain is never gonna hurt you,
So wait and the skies will all be blue.

It never rains but what it pours;
So what if all your troubles come in bunches,
Keep sticking to your silly little hunches,
And the sun will come shining through.

Bide your time and keep on hummin',
Don't you frown and sit around and weep.
Wait your turn, your day is comin',
And you'll be there on top of the heap!

It never rains but what it pours;
You may as well get all your worries over,
From then on you're gonna be in clover!
Smile when you should cry,
For every cloud there'll be a rainbow,
There'll be a sunbeam for every raindrop by and by!",5

"Wonderful pals are always hard to find
Some folks have one, some folks have none
And I was alone for years, but fate was kind
And in the end, sent me a friend
Although he's not much higher than my knee
Still he's the greatest thing on earth to me

Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbours a chase
But his smile is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys
He's always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're a vision to see

And when my work is done
Coming home from the setting sun
To the gate he will start to run
And then I'll kiss my boy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Little devil, that's what they say
But to me he's an angel of joy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbours a chase
But his smile, his little smile, is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys, Ha-ha-ha
He's always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're his Mother's
And they're a vision to me

And when my work is done
Coming home, coming home to the setting sun
From the gate he'll start to run
And then, Ohhh! I'll kiss my boy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Little devil, that's what they say
But to me he's an angel of joy",5
"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",6
"This is it, my great romance 
I want to hang on to this one big chance 
You're mine, my loneliness dies 
I feel fine, with stars in my eyes 
Oh, it fills me up to such a height 
To know this is so very real and right 
And I, thought love passed me by 
But I must admit this is it! 
Repeat last verse 
This is it, this is it, this is it...",6
"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",6
"Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more",5
"Love your skimmer Judy, where did you grab it?

My hat?
Oh Bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
Because there's a very interesting story 
Connected with this hat, there really is.
I was walking down the street the other day,
Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""
I went in, the saleslady put it on my head and I 
Thought it was a little matronly

There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

"You really shouldn't have done it
You hadn't any right
I really shouldn't have let you
Kiss me.
And although it was wrong
I never was strong.
So as long as you've begun it
And you know you shouldn't have done it.

Oh.
Do it again.
I may say no. no. no. no. no.
But do it again.
My lips just ache
To have you take the kiss
That's waiting for you
You know if you do
You won't regret it
Come and get it.

Oh.
No one is near
I may cry oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
But no one can hear.
Mamma may scold me
Coz' she told me
It was naughty but then

Please,
Do it again.
Yes do it again. And again and again and again and again and again
Turn out the light.
And hold me close
In your arms
All through the night.
I know tomorrow morning
You will say
Goodbye and Amen.

But until then
Please do it again.",6

Ringing through you

He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by

Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare
But then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Trouble's fly away and life is easy go

Let me go 'way from this lonely town
Won't be long till my song will be true

Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul
What is love but a cradle to sorrow

"The snow makes teardrops on my window
The wind blows memories through my hall
And I am all alone on New Year's eve 
The time I need you most of all

The gay ones don their silly paper hats 
And blow their stupid little horns
At midnight they will all be singing Auld Lang Syne 
But the sad ones sit alone before the fire and sip a glass of lonely wine

I wish you a Happy New Year darling 
May your new love be bright and fair
I hope he'll do those special things for you 
That I would do if I were there.

I love the days we spent together
Before the old year lost it's shine
I'll keep that memory locked within my heart
That Happy New Year you were mine",6

Some folks have one, some folks have none
And I was alone for years, but fate was kind
And in the end, sent me a friend
Although he's not much higher than my knee
Still he's the greatest thing on earth to me

Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbours a chase
But his smile is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys
He's always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're a vision to see

And when my work is done
Coming home from the setting sun
To the gate he will start to run
And then I'll kiss my boy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Little devil, that's what they say
But to me he's an angel of joy

You try to comb your hair but can't arrange it,
Spill orange juice on your dress and have to change it!
Then all day long,
Everything you touch goes wrong!

Teacher told us, when this happens, never to whine or wail;
The same thing happens in life, but on a much larger scale!

It never rains but what it pours;
If lady luck should happen to desert you,
A bit of rain is never gonna hurt you,
So wait and the skies will all be blue.

It never rains but what it pours;
So what if all your troubles come in bunches,
Keep sticking to your silly little hunches,
And the sun will come shining through.

Bide your time and keep on hummin',
Don't you frown and sit around and weep.
Wait your turn, your day is comin',
And you'll be there on top of the heap!

It never rains but what it pours;
You may as well get all your worries over,
From then on you're gonna be in clover!

For every cloud there'll be a rainbow,
There'll be a sunbeam for every raindrop by and by!",5

To hold you ever so tight 
And to feel in the night the nearness of you",5

When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

The ocean's roar
A thousand drums

Can there be any doubt

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

It's easy to see you don't need a palace

Back in Ohio where I come from
I've done a lot of dreaming and I've travelled some
But I never thought I'd see the day
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe
(want to take a ride on the Santa Fe)

I would lean across my windowsill
And hear the whistle echoing across the hill
Then I'd watch the lights till they fade away
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

What a thrill (what a great big wonderful thrill)
With the wheels singing ""westward ho""
Right from the day I heard them start
'Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart

When I'm old and grey and settled down
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town
Then I'll spend my busman's holiday
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

All aboard! (we came across the country lickety-split)
(rolling ninety miles an hour)
I can't believe I'm here at last 
Woo-oo-ooo!
(when you go travelling, it's best for you 
to take the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!)
I can't believe that anything could go so fast

Then you pull that throttle, whistle blows
Huffing and puffing and away she goes

Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, gab, gab, gab
Aristotle, mathematics, economics, antique chairs
The classics, the comics, darling, who cares?
There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

Cut
Sorry
When the parlour lights are lowered and the family isn't in
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, chin, chin, chin
When there's music softly playing and I'm sitting on your lap
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, yap, yap, yap
Forward passes, second baggers, or a jockey who is hot.
Or boxing, or hockey, darling, so what?

I'll attempt some other evening.
Well you can call for me at nine

Calling?
But if you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
What do you mean the same old line?
Same line

You asked me about my hat,
You've been standing there for an hour 
And a half talking your big fat head off

I thought
About golf

I just
You didn't even let me finish my story
I told you what I would do
Oh darling, let me finish
Steady, steady

Oh
It's so nice to close your lips with mine.",6

"There's a story told of a little Japanese
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die
Poor Butterfly",6
"Here he comes lookin' for his baby
It's for sure, sure and not for maybe
Don't ask when will the lucky day be
Here he comes and let him tell you himself:

If I seem to scintillate
It's because I've got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love
You don't have to ask me
I won't waste your time
But if you should ask me
Why I feel sublime
I'm

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight

Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood

There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails
(alternate line: In my top hat and my white tie and my tails)

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight",6
"Suppertime, I should set the tables
'Cause it's suppertime, somehow I'm not able
'Cause that man o' mine ain't comin' home no more

Suppertime, kids'll soon be yellin' for their suppertime
How I keep from tellin' 'em?
That man o' mine ain't comin' home no more

How I keep explainin' when they ask me where he's gone
How I keep from cryin' when I bring their supper on
How can I remind them to pray at their humble board?
How can I be thankful when they start to thank the Lord?

Lord, suppertime, kids'll soon be yellin' for their suppertime
How I keep from tellin' 'em?
That man o' mine ain't comin' home no more
Ain't comin' home no more

So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be the one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

You've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time, you'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

"The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away

No more his eager call
The writings on the wall
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray

The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same

Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're on to
But, fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he will turn up
There's just no letup the live-long night and day

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman looking for
The man that got away
The man that got away",5

Listen, Mammy mine...

When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine

And ""Old Black Joe"" just as though you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing ""The Swanee River""
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye-baby with a Dixie melody

Any time
I hear a mammy sing her babe to sleep
Slumber deep
That's the time
The shadows 'round my heart begin to creep
And I weep
Wonder why I went away
What a fool I've been
Take me back to yesterday
In your arms again...

B-B-B-Baby
Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

Respect yourself, hey, hey

"There's one thing to think of when you're blue,
There are others around much worse off than you!
If a load of troubles should arrive,
Laugh and say, ""It's great to be alive!"";

And keep your sunny side up, up,
Hide the side that gets blue.
If you have nine sons in a row,
Baseball teams make money, you know!

Keep your funny side up, up,
Let your laughter come through, do!
Stand up on your legs,
Be like two fried eggs,
Keep your sunny side up!

Life can be a pleasure or a pain,
Good or bad, successful or in vain;
Happiness is just a point of view,
If you have it here's the thing to do;

Keep your sunny side up, up,
Drown a frown with a smile.
If you think it's raining for you,
Just remember, others are blue.

Always look for the bright side,
Start the day on the right side;
You'll find life worthwhile,
Learn to wear a smile,
Keep your sunny side up!",6

Whispering why you'll never grieve me

Just whispering that I love you",6

Telling of the wonders they can do.
There's con men and there's boosters,
Card sharks and crap-shooters.
They congregate around the Metropole.
They wear fancy ties and laces,
But where do they get their aces?
They all have got an ace down in the hole!

Some of them write to the old folks for coin,
And that is their ace in the hole,
And others have friends on the old Tenderloin;
That's their old ace in the hole.

They'll tell you of trips that they're going to take
From Florida to the North Pole.
The fact is, their name would be mud,
Like a chump playing stud,
If they lost that old ace down in the hole!",6

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",5

I gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see 
And be what I want to be

When I think more than I want to think
I do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
 
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she, coming to me nearly here? 

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love? 
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

While you sit there contemplating,
You wound up left for dead (left for dead)
Life is what happens while you're busy making your excuses.
Another day, another casualty.
And that won't happen to me.

[Chorus]

Ooh, ooh, ooh.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
When I'm gone-

Let's go!

Won't look back,
When I say goodbye.
I'm gonna leave this a hole behind me,
Gonna take what's mine tonight.
Because every wasted day becomes a wasted chance.
You're gonna wake up feeling sorry,
Because life won't wait,
I guess it's up to you.

[Chorus]

Ooh, ooh, ooh.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.",4

Come into my arms baby, I know how you feel 
Come into my arms baby, this love for you is real

To be with someone who you've cared for so long

Spend time with me I'll guarantee you'll see
What love can be

Give me the chance I'm thinking of you

In you I find forgiveness and sin's release

You've given me wisdom; now I can see
I want to keep on growing and show others too
Lord, I'll be forever grateful to you

Once I had to have the very best Lord
Then was blessed and found I needed less
For you alone, dear Savior, have now shown
That you are not impressed with what I own
Thank you for giving me my brand new start
Lord, thank you for this feeling way down in  my heart

Thanks to you I can forget the sad years
You took away the heartaches and the tears
You saw me through, my Savior, you always knew
I would make it if I would believe in you; And I do..

I would write when I was young
Back then I did it just for fun
Not knowing it was all a part of a plan
This precious gift you've given me
Can uplift many easily
And help them all
To see the light of love again

Some just don't understand my goal
Adversity may take it's toll
You gave me all the strength I need to see
That in the dark I'll always know
That burdens only make me grow
I've yet to see
The very best there is of me

So guide my heart
Direct my mind
Oh, Lord I pray
Each time I find
Words fall like rain
And ease the pain
So guide my heart

Have made me thankful, helped me see
That you will always be there by my side
Seems the heartaches have all gone
You gave me hope to carry on
Forever in your precious love I will abide

I had a dream that forever changed my life
I was redeemed through holy sacrifice
I close my eyes to shut out all His pain
Yet clear as glass I see it all again

I see the cross, the cross of Calvary
I see the one, who died for you and me
I see the blood on the path where He was led
A crown of thorns, held tightly on His head

(CHORUS)
My precious Lord relieved me of my sins
He sealed my fate for all eternity
My heart will be filled with joy again
Oh, precious Lord, when you return for me

As I awoke I saw a light so clear
Then Jesus spoke and took away my fear
I'll spread the word of His redeeming  grace
Open your heart and feel the Lord's embrace

He'll give you peace, just like he's done for me
If you believe, He will set you free
For that's the key that will open up the door
So you can dwell with the Lord forever more

"TOO OLD BLUES

I stayed home with my babes
All during their growing years
I ran my business on the phone
And was there to dry their tears
So that when they each would leave the nest
I could rest assured I'd given them my best
And now... my wings have come unfurled 
Have things I must inform the world
But those who hold the key
They keep on telling' me
Honey, you're too old

[Chorus:]
I've got the too old blues
Been hearing it far too long
It makes no sense... so it's time to scold
When I have so much to give
Why does it matter how long I've lived
I look and think and act young
Write unique songs that must be sung
I'm not useless, I'm strong and bold
So stop giving me those Too Old Blues

Worked so hard, saved some cash
Supported my loved ones dreams
Found energy to work on mine
And surprising as it seems
True friends took notice of my goals
Kept saying hey girl... you owe this to yourself
Pursue that dream while there's still time
Found the door and paid my dime
But those who hold the key
They keep on telling me
Honey, you're too old

I'll always stay young
Have songs to be sung
I'll never quit - I refuse
So stop giving me those Too Old Blues

Years ago I got me a CB radio
So I'd be safer on the road at night
That's how I came to know a trucker, ""Jersey Joe""
The only man to ever treat me right

We agreed to meet at a diner one night
Where Joe pulled out the story of my life
He said,  ""You've been abused...your handle must be ""Blues""
Then six months later, Joe made me his wife

""Blues"" had been my handle
'Cause life had served me a handful of strife
""Blues"" had been my handle

Yeah, ""Blues"" had been my handle
'Til true love lit a candle
Now ""Joy"" is the handle I use

Oh, what fun to see the whole country with my man
I'm by his side on almost every trip
I sing a bluesy song, Joe loves to sing along
So happy that the two of us just click

Blues are now the songs I sing of other folks
'Cause I have filed away my painful past
Joe's brought me so much joy... I'm more than just his toy

It had two big pockets and of course, it had a bib

CHORUS)
Whatever happened to Nathaniel Strong
The Pastor's son who filled my girlhood dreams
We shared singing and a strict upbringing
And to this day I remember our song
And I wonder (spoken)
Whatever happened to Nathaniel Strong

A couple we knew made out in back of Miller's Dam
They married quickly and soon were pushing a pram
They'd been better off at the movies, it seemed to us
But we followed the rules and didn't make a fuss

CHORUS

(BRIDGE)
Daydreams back then about Nathaniel Strong
Made me forget the crazy rules
Now I know they taught us right from wrong
But I can't help wonderin' about Nathaniel Strong

"WHEN I'M CHASING A DREAM

(CHORUS)
Chasing a dream keeps boredom at bay
When I'm chasing a dream
My work seems like play
And there's a reason to face each new day
When I'm chasing a dream
When I'm chasing a dream

Early on in life I was always dreaming
Never a day went by that I wasn't scheming
One wish came true I'll not forget 
The day I became a majorette

Lying in bed I'd dream of the man I'd marry
Later I thought of the child I'd some day carry
Blessed with both, but needed more from life
Than being a mother and a wife

CHORUS 
 
My goal these days is to be a hit songwriter
A little success has made the challenge lighter
And if I set my sights sky high
This dream could last until I die

CHORUS

(BRIDGE)
When I've given all I've got to give
And a rainbow's no longer in view
That's when I'll know for certain
It's time to close the curtain
And find something new to pursue

CHORUS

(TAG)
New ones may come unforeseen.. but
I'll always be chasing a dream

"(WHY  DONCHA)  KISS  ME  LIKE  THAT

Tell me Honey, why do ya leave for a snack 
Right when you see there's a passionate kiss
'A comin' on TV
Well, the next time it happens I'm callin? you back
To take a good look and answer me..
Why doncha kiss me like that

(CHORUS)
Why doncha kiss me like that
Just like when we were dating
Why doncha kiss me like that
I'm ready, willing and waiting
Oh, how I'm anticipating
The day you kiss me like that
	
Last week we saw that couple in the town square
After a tender kiss they lingered in each other's arms
So turned off, you insisted we leave then and there
The fire in my heart had four alarms
You were totally unaware

CHORUS

(BRIDGE)
Now before you kiss my lips
Listen up honey to these few tips (spoken)
Kiss my eyelids, neck and nose
Kiss my fingertips and toes
And feel my temperature rise 
When your lips touch those
			
CHORUS

Why doncha kiss me like that (4X)
		
Come on, give us a big, juicy kiss? YES!  (spoken)

"YOU  MAKE  ME   SHINE

When I wake up I think I'm dreaming
When you're sleeping next to me
You're the one who makes me seem so great
With you I'm all that I can be
You make me feel I can do anything
You make me know it will be fine
I push a little farther and a little harder
I'm so lucky you are mine

(CHORUS)
You make me shine
Every single day in a special kind of way
You make me shine
There are things that I can do
Just because of loving you
You make me shine 
      			
When I'm at work I must stay focused
There's so much I have to do
If my mind wonders to happy thoughts
I am always back with you
It doesn't matter what we're doing
Because with you it's always fine
You pump me up to win,  then I'm ready to begin
I'm so lucky you are mine

When I come home my heart beats faster
It's that pretty face I see
My days are brighter because of you
A new world with much to see
What did I do to have this blessing
Having you here in my life
Whatever I did I would do it all again
But this time I'd do it twice

CHORUS TWICE

"CHURCH CALLED THE RISEN SON
(""House of the Risin' Sun"" melody)

There is a church outside of town
It's called the risen son
The builder had great plans but died
Before the inside was done

Brother Ben carved God's commandments
In marble on ten walls
Was centered on a wooded lot
Far from shopping malls

Now this strategy using ten walls
Formed a definite decagon
The most unusual church around
Though Ben's gone, it lives on

[Instrumental]
The lovely stained glass skylight
Shows the Savior with a smile
His arms are reaching heavenward
Rising from the golden tile

Oh, I love to go inside that church
Even though it's not complete
I find such peace and solace there
As I pray, standing 'neath his feet

Perhaps this church called the risen son
In the Father's eyes is done
No pulpit or pews are needed there
To pray to Him, one on one

Oh, how I love to worship Him there
In the Church Called the Risen Son

Lyrics: Judy Welden",6
"GRACE

My life is filled with untraveled roads
A map of special  places where I've never been
And where I'm bound, grace only knows
Amazingly,  shows me how to begin

(CHORUS)
I can't see it, but it's always there
I can't earn it, still it's close as a prayer
It goes far beyond the rainbow's end
The Lamb's blood flowed
Now GRACE is my friend

No humble Hannah, life was a game
I had to be in charge and call each shot
I sped in high gear on a fast freight train
'Til GRACE appeared and changed the plot

CHORUS

(BRIDGE)
Opportunity's window saw me through  
I raced down a one-way street
God was the answer and only GRACE knew
That with His love I would be complete

Want you to know 
How hard I'm tryin'
To walk with you
Oh, Lord, take me back			
			
Take me back Lord; set my spirit free
I've been so blind, but now see things differently
I was selfish and had to have my own way
And seldom heard what you had to say

I promise you I will change my ways

And follow your wishes faithfully

"MIXTURE OF MARY & MARTHA

True balance is something I've struggled with all my grown up life
I wanted to use my talents, yet be a good wife
I'm torn between Mary and Martha in all I do
I want to pray more, Lord, but my work kept me from you

(CHORUS)
Seems like Mary & Martha seldom agreed
As they tried to please you and see to your needs
I'm a mixture of Mary & Martha
And I always will be
Jesus, I beg you... please accept me for me 

Mary  and Martha showed gracious hospitality
They both served faithfully, yet differently
Martha cooked and kept their home fresh as an ocean breeze
Mary washed your feet and listened, while on her knees

CHORUS

Let me be like both of those women way back then
Being the best I can be and serving you to the end

"YOUR FAITHFULNESS (RESTORES MY FAITH)

You know my needs, Lord, even before I ask
You show an easier way to do a difficult task
When worries come like a thief in the night
The hope you give puts up an excellent fight

(CHORUS)
Oh, Lord, your faithfulness
Restores my faith
Making it never-ending
Like a river flowing out to sea
You keep it ever growing 
Like the rings on an old oak tree
Your faithfulness restores my faith

When trouble comes I know you're always there
You've never given me more to handle than I could bear
And thanks to you my life is fulfilled
Adversity threatens, but I can say 'yield'

My way of giving back, dear Lord
Is letting others know in song
If they would just believe
And trust your word
They'd see your faithfulness would last	
Their whole life long

"CO-WRITTEN  BLUES 

You and me, we never can agree
On most things that affect every day life
But everyone knows congeniality flows
When there's a blues song, we're about to co-write

The message might be sad, yet it's only good news 
When we come together for Co-written blues

(CHORUS)
Co-written Blues... Co-written blues
We get along, writing a blues song
Co-written blues... Co-written blues
Oh, why is it only good news  
When we're co-writing the blues
                               
You and me, we have a history
Of an on-again, off again love life
We seldom go wrong with the formula of a song
But we've never found one for husband and wife

The message might be sad, yet it's only good news 
When we come together for co-written blues

Perhaps we should refuse
To write any more blues
Until we've written our own love song

So many times I'd told you no

Parties make me come alive ... you think that 3's a crowd
I spy a unique table ... your eyes settle on the dust
On my nearly new LeSabre ... you found a bit  of rust

Get lost Mister Bad News, your sad news keeps me down

Mixed in with my primroses ... you found a patch of weeds
And folks you call free loaders ... I say have special needs

"HEART  ON  A  RAMPAGE

She had big plans when she moved to town
Seemed so happy, you'd never see her frown
Everyone she met became a friend
No one knew she had a broken heart
That needed to mend	

She dug in her heels and found success
The locals in her field are not impressed
Still she smiles and tries to please
Though treated like she has a contagious disease

(CHORUS)		                    
She has a heart on a rampage
Her smile's a restless disquise
That heart on a rampage
Is reflected in her eyes
Torn apart and filled with rage
Heart on a rampage

She sometimes wonders if she's to blame
Forgives and protects the cause of the pain
She knows she's put on permanent hold		
Because of well-deserved success and can't be consoled

The rest of the world has nothing but praise
It's a mystery why she stays
In a town that shows no respect
Her kindness belies the anger that's slow to detect		

CHORUS  TWICE

Torn apart and filled with rage
Heart on a rampage

Heart on a rampage (4 times ... fade on last one)

"IF  YOU'RE MAN  ENOUGH

(CHORUS)
If you're man enough to stick around
After all I put us through
Then I'll be woman enough    
To say I'm sorry and start anew
But if you're angry enough to say goodbye
Then I promise not to cry
And won't even try to deny
I played a leading part
In breaking both our hearts
So if you're man enough to stay
I'll be woman enough to play
By the rules of love

I didn't value what I had
That your star shone brighter than the rest
Then I put my love to the test
Now  I know that you're the best
And my thoughts just focus now on you
It seems the joke is now on me
'Cause I'm the one who's blue
Now knowing what you plan to do
Is killing me....sooo

When we first me you swept me off my feet
Said San Antonio livin' would be a treat	
Gave up my car and my old southern home
Thought life with you would beat my bein' alone

You're a long distance trucker always on the road
You dumped me on your mama, hey that's a load
I worked to feed your kids; you paid for your truck
No money for six months; you said ""tough luck""

(CHORUS)
Just leave me alone.. I don't need you
Too many years now I've been on my own
You've given me much grief & pain & it's not right
I'll be brief and don't want to start a fight
Leave me alone  (spoken)
Just leave me alone

Why do you always call from out of town
And bring up hurts that really cut me down
Then after each uncalled-for bitter fight
I toss and turn and worry half the night
	
You lied and beat me up when times were rough
You must believe that I've had enough
No need to write sad notes or beg on the phone
Why don't you just give up and leave me alone

CHORUS

I've done most every job 'cept walk the street
I'm on my own again and feel complete
You say you love me;  it'll be different this time
I know you'd walk out; leave me without a dime

Can't you find ONE GOOD THING
To say to me today	
And it hurts that you won't wear the ring
I gave you on our wedding day
What can I do
To start pleasin' you
So that good things are all
You'll ever want to say
But for now just find ONE GOOD THING
To make this hurtin' go away 		  
			  
You seem to think I'm the cause
Of all that's wrong in our lives
You won't admit your own flaws
And wear a tailor-made disguise
ONE GOOD THING that I recall
Is the man that you once were	
You were always there for me
I had it all;  Now it's clear
That I'm no longer first
And I fear my heart might burst	
The spiteful words you choose
Can't help but make you lose
'Cause you no longer can say
ONE GOOD THING

Just ONE GOOD THING is all I want to hear
Can't you find ONE GOOD THING

"ROLLER COASTER RIDE

When our love is going right it's a rare surprise
My heart just wants to soar
You lift me to staggering heights of paradise
That I've never known before

Then when one thing goes wrong, oh baby
We let it keep hangin' around
Why can't we stay on top and start leaving
The grief scattered on the ground

[Chorus:]
Our love is like a roller coaster ride
We fly so high we almost reach the sky
But when we're starting to descend
It looks like it's all gonna end
We go round,  round, up and down 
And our hearts are caught up in the slide
Here we go climbing that hill once more
Our love is like a roller coaster ride  

Didn't you say the sweetest thing, oh darlin'
It was just the other night
You promised to buy me a ring so sparklin'
Right before we had that fight

Can't we just agree this time, oh baby
Why does it matter who has to pay
Let's make up and hasten our climb, then maybe
On top is where we'll stay

[Chorus]

Here we go climbing that hill once more
Our love is like a roller coaster ride  

We go round & round, up & down
Our love is like a roller coaster ride
Round & round, up & down
Our love is like a roller coaster ride  [3x]

"SHADES OF BLUE

Spoken:  What makes you think you can waltz back into my life again 
			
(Chorus)
How many shades of blue
Are you gonna dish me out today
How many shades of blue
Before I kiss you goodbye and say
This is the way it's gotta be
I'm leavin'...doncha see
You've played with my heart too long
Your many shades of blue
Have only made me strong

Powder blues' the color used
To describe my milder shade of blue
Ever since the day we met
Even then you made me fret
And sky blues' the color of your eyes
The very ones that told me tons of lies

(CHORUS)

Royal is the brightest blue
That one proved my loyalty to you
Like a puppet you could mold
I would melt 'til you turned cold
I found aqua blues' your fickle side
Walked in and out of my life just like the tide

(CHORUS)

The darkest shade was navy blue
That was when I waved goodbye to you
I was watchin' from the train
You were standin' in the rain
There was nothing more that you could do
You'd given me too many shades of blue

Too many shades of blue

"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",7
"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as he

shoulda never put my hands on your daughter
But I ain't askin' you to drop no charges shit
I did what I did, deserve the consequence
I can't see myself copping a plea
to one of these niggaz who bleeds the same as me
I'ma G, I will cock and squeeze
the same as E, take it to the same degree, please
so let's leave it alone, we don't need this at home

Now this has been one hell of a year
This has been one hell of a ride, I'm tellin' you guys
They'd thought we'd never survive, Jeky'll and Hyde

Dead or alive, left with no choice but to um, better our lives
Get up and strive, but um, get up and roll, get up ya know
Get up and go, these motherfuckers ain't lettin' us go 
So we get up and take it, get up and make it happen for us
Nobody can gt up and take this

It's part of my nature, part of my wake up
Part of my waist yup, pardon my waist chump
For this part of my waist chump, come part in of your face, yup

Uh, Santana, let's do it
Yeah, DipSet

[Verse 1 - Juelz Santana]
Man where ever I go, I hold it down
I blow it down, you see me, believe me it's (Going down)
These hoes love me to death, they mumble under they breath
Lovely duets, boy, I'm (Going down)
I thought Mary J. was under my steps, nah I'm just playing
Love when ya sweat, keep singing (Going down)
I'm so fucking amazin, like Jordan to the league
When he first came in, it's (Going down)
I know you mad, my career's blowing up
Going up, holding up, and your's is (Going down)
Slowly but surely, so coked to the shorty's
Caught by the boys, the judge says your (Going down)
I had to call up my lawyer, gotta make court
And yawning, it's four in the morning, it's (Going down)
I need be out by the morning
Man the police need me to be out by the morning, or nothings (Going down)

[Chorus - Juelz Santana]
Yeah, I tryed to help ya, tryed to warn ya
Tryed to tell ya it's (Going down)
But, wouldn't believe it, couldn't believe it
Look I succeded, it's (Going down)
Baby keep walking wit ya hip, I keep walking wit a limp
Yeah you talking to a pimp it's (Going down)
Again, I tryed to help ya, tryed to warn ya
Tryed to tell ya it's (Going down)

[Verse 2 - Juelz Santana]
Now look, I'm back stronger than ever
Money's longer than ever, longer Baretta, it's (Going down)
Man we could get it on, it's whatever
The morns the better, I'm shorter, I'm better whenever it's (Going down)
Got a new chick, badder than ever
Ass fatter than ever, got it together and love (Going down)
No bud, no kiss, no hug
No rub, no bath, no tub, just love (Going down)
Yeah, that's my kind of baby
That's my kind of lady it's (Going down)
And the purse, you might find a eighty
Underneath her lip gloss, shorty keeps some lip gloss she's (Going down)
And that's why I love her, that's also why I don't trust her
Think she got her a sucker, nope (Going down)
Got another thing coming, not a baby but a
{???} believe me I done it (Going down)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Juelz Santana]
Yeah, mama look at me now, mama look at me how
Ya beautiful child it's (Going down)
Mama look up and smile, you made a beautiful child
Still shooting the pound it's (Going down)
Gotta survive, maneuver through towns
Gotta drive, smooth through the town, or it's (Going down)
Cops on my ass, gotta shoot through the town
Shooting the pound, I ruined it now it's (Going down)
Only question is, will I get caught
Will I get cuffed, will I see court, will people see me (Going down)
No they won't, man I'ma survivor
Plus I gotta lady cop that's a rider, so nothing's (Going down)
You might catch me, crossing the border
Crossing the water, three ladies out and deported it's (Going down)
I caught 'em swimming, north of the border
Lost in the water, caught 'em and scored 'em, now they (Going down)

Man all I hear is Santana this, Santana that
Santana you can't do this, Santana you can't do that
Man why I can't I just smoke a blunt and be me
That's how I feel..
Okay it's Santana, I'm back again
You know what man? What? What?
This is... Yea

You fuckas don't know a damn thing about me (Nope)
A piece, a part, a hamstring about me
The streets my heart you can't get it out me, it's
You fuckas know me, it was a sharp throb in my bones
I looked it was my own flesh, heart, and my bones, problems at home (Home)
So I left them there, got up out the atmosphere
Misery, loves company, I don't respect that there
Dip Set on the posta, boy for coming so close to
Being the black Lagrosta Nostra
Jim is my big buzzin, Zeek's my big cousin
Killa's my big nigga, also my big brother
We are the Dip family, get a grip family
Nothin alive can divide this family
So come on roll with the Set, come on roll with the best
The pain is felt niggaz know that you stressed (Oh)
The game itself don't notice your stress
You been left smokin, zoning on steps (No)
That's not the way to go, but that's the way you'll go
If you don't get up off you ass and find a way to go
Streets to rap, yea that's the way I went
Now its beats and rhymes, that's the way I pay the rent
Fuck what ya think nigga
Cause this is..

Niggaz know me",5

You?
Who wishin', who frontin', who want it from me?

Do you believe me?
Don't you believe me, won't you believe me?

On any given Sunday or any given Monday
We headed up the runway
Uptown yea we headed up a one-way, her head is in my lap
So I let her do her one thang
She was Jamaican so I fed her bread and dumplings
Veggie pads and rumcake
Told her, said she's 18 and lived crazy just like me

Eighties baby just like me so
Hey baby you know what your boy holds all night
Long pipe, long strokes

Matter fact, let's get it one more time Santana

Man I roll through, stroll through
Flag on the ride side of my whole crew screaming
They'll get you, they'll twist you
They'll split ya whole body in half
Then dismiss you like

But I'm lookin' for a bad lil' mama
Get mad like her papa, got an ass like her mama
Got her own, won't ask for a dollar
Go half on a scama and will laugh when I holla
Yea, that's love baby, yea dats love

I make music I consider a challenge
Like this here, reminds me of Gilligan's Island
And that reminds of Harlem, where my niggaz is whylin
The only borough that was built on an island, woah
You fucks probably ain't know, if they cut off the bridges
We'd be stuck, forced to live on the Island
But we gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Niggaz still want beef than holla
You think you bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
A young Muhammad Atta, no plane lessons, cocaine lessons, just a plot of towers
Before they crashed and divided the towers
I'm hurtin' working hard to reprovide the towers, like
Bring 'em back up, lift 'em back up
Niggaz back up, or lift us back up

[Chorus: 2x]
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Y'all can't fuck with me, okay

[Verse]
Now let me hear you say, OKAY
It's Santana the great again, tie him up, bandana his face again
I tried to tell 'em it's no escaping the basics
And no escaping the hatred and no escaping the matrix man
Only Neo is me, no Cleo can see my future, if she did I'd shoot her
They tried to say the mission was impossible
I came through, crew did it, got it poppin' too
Two bitches on my side both prostitutes
Gray smoke, mobster's suit, yeah they get it poppin' too
I get my ace holes chopped in two, dimes, quarters, rocks in two
The fiends cop it too
Yeah, look at 'em rockin' two, rockin' boat, Rock n' Jock
Stop and plot, hot a BLDAT
Fucka, this nigga gotta stop, out of sight, out of mind
He gotta go, he out of line

[Chorus: 2x]
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, Okay, Okay
Okay, Okay, Okay
Y'all can't fuck with me, OKAY",6

(Verse)
Now once again, a deep thought of Aaliyah
Crosses my mind, I rethought that I seen her, all in my mind
Memories of Big, all in the lime light, all of the time, all on his grind, right
I'm blacking out about 'Pac, blacking out on them cops
Middle finger, after blacking out from them shots
And I go visit Shyne, in my distant mind
I tell him stay up, cause in there it's a different grind
I see Eazy and Jam Master laughin'
Big L still rappin, like it never happened
I got a sick sense with me, God picked then sent me
To this earth place, to win in the first place
Visions of mommy, on an Island somewhere, yeah, I designed just for my mommy
My whole life is a blessing, that's why I'm so nice, so right
Approach mics with aggression
I got the type of obsession I would like to progress in
I write about me, and the life of my henchmen
I blow dice, roll twice to the deuce
That was nights, that was life on the stoop
This shit gotta change
Can't forget the hard white in the boot
White car stripped with the blue, narc parked right in the coup, damn
They riding around with a license to shoot
I'm riding around with no license and hoop, follow me now
Follow me down, this yellow brick road
187, hello, every ghettos zip code
I had to change my pace up, so I went left, while everybody went right
Had to switch the waste up, now I'm better off
Met Cam set it off, did the mix tape now look dip set is off
Put the bid in Def Jam bet it all
First writers refusal, Dame wouldn't let us off
So we matched it, we signed labels with Dashius
Cam goes platinum, the set is up next
A double album, we set for the best
Juelz is the test, which is me, fail or succeed
But still I'm here in the flesh, handing you breath
Mixed with a lot of thought, The Santana, Robb Report
I bring you more than just music I bring you me and all of my movement
I bring my whole life all in the booth shit
And I'm all in the booth with, the headphones on, the lights cut down
And all of this true shit",5
"Ya probably ain't expecting this one
Nope,yea clap clap un hun,
This something my grandmother would dance to or something
Sha ba doop doop doo
Sha ba doop doop doo

[Chorus]
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall
(i know you wishing it would rain)
Nights like this I wish
That rain drop would fall

Ay Grandma and Grandpa
Look at ya grandson, I done made it far
Damn nana, I know its killing ya bones that damn cancer
I wish I had an answer,but I don't I'm jus wishin for an answer
Watchin my mamma cry, she's watchin her mamma die
Every second I'm drying my mamma eyes, she so proud of her son
See right through my mamma eyes, she jus follow the drips
You can't dodge the rain but you can follow the drips
And every drop of rain that falls, has a drop a pain involved,you better believe
88 cocaine it solves, now the dope came in charge yup
I see my niggaz for what they really are,what we really are
The dips we really are, let it rain

[Chorus]

It has been long fights like this
Long days ,long nights nights like this
I'm wishing for rain. Nothing but the wind ever came
Little girls with they skirt up, the world's getting worser
Man I twirled through the world in a roaster
Twirling the smoke up, I be so high
Shit a week goes by, I still think the week just started
Man weed still sparking,still in tune with the street man
He still sparking, go ahead nigga leap feel frogish
These streets I harnish, my peeps my partners
Cam, Jim, Zeek my sponsors, black, griz, snags my monstrous
Paper, drugs, twin my archor. Robs, 40, doe, guard
Bus, train and go hard, let it rain

[Chorus]

This is a story,about a young boy wishin' for glory
Rap, riches and glory. some people I'll love to share it with
Yea my people my thugs I'll share it with.
You can't eat through this love I'm dealing with
You can't see through this love I'm dealing with
You can't be through or eat through this love I'm dealing with
Its real I'm feeling it my niggaz. cats plan on killing it
Rats real I'm realing it all men like fishermen
Say(hey hey hey baby)
Drive sticks while sticking em, young chicks I'm dicking 'em
All down and yea they all down
But why it got to be like this, why every girl I meet got to be like this
Let it rain

[Chorus]

Let it rain
I'm just sitting here
Wishing it would rain
I'm just sitting here waiting for the rain
Waiting for the rain",6

Hit the gas, now we rich with cash
And when I hear Squalie!

Cooked more caine, push off dames
While you dumb niggaz stand there
And look all lame
I done popped and took off chains
Now Ivory dump ice on me like my team
Won a football game!",5
"My baby don't mess around not mine
Because she loves me so 
And this I know fo sho 
But does she really want to 
But can't stand to see me

For stickin together

"My name mean a lot to me, pain mean a lot to me
Fame means nothing, but the game means a lot to me
I slang caine on these blocks for weeks
Ever since Rocky III, and the death of Apollo Creed
I was a tiny little poppy seed
As grimey as I could be, as sheiesty as I could be
Niggaz who live nicely, who don't understand the life of me
Other niggaz don't like me, and wanna take my life from me
They don't understand that I love it, and I like the beef
The raw, the guns, the violence, it's all right with me
I be laying in the cut where the sniper be
Righteously, waiting for you to get out the driver's seat
I don't think like usual people
Who think like usual people, who don't think right
I think like Muslims, in movements of people, who move they people
And move on your people, power is stronger than voo doo and evil
I'm immune, I drunk the juice, took a root from the needle
Still trying to figure out, why I do, the crimes I do
With the minds IQ, of an Einstein too
Tell 'em, Cha-cha, and bon, bon goo, they think I'm crazy, well I do too
Leave me alone please, I'm in my two-three zone please
Nothing can stop me, you fuckers can't stop me

[""Why"" continues to play]

[Verse 2]
It's like my life keeps turning around
Every second I need a lighter, I keep burning it down
I smoke so much, I could nurture a pound
My thoughts are always foggy, they blurring right now listen
I see the game for what it's worth, pain, fame and work
Girls walk with they brain in their skirt
So while you're fucker, they thinking
Of ways to get even, or a way out the hood, they make up a reason
For the judge, for you take him and see him
Until you face a subpena, that'll change your demeanor
So be careful, where you skating through this game
Remember it's other niggaz playing, skating in your lane
Don't get clipped, or stripped skating in the rain
Cause niggaz will keep rolling, and skating on your brain
That's just the rules and regulations of the game
When you playing you, you playing, and you paying like you weigh in, so..
If not, those wolves aiming where you layin'
And waiting on you patient with that thing up in the basement
That's why I walk with that thing out, when I'm pasting
Cause I know these niggaz hate it, that their little sisters love it
And their girls really want it, plus I'm frontin
Twenty three big truckin, new Z, new bucket
Fuck it

Got manners, got morals, got sense of respect,
Cause when you gone, boy that's all you got left,

Open a strangers candy, those are the strangest candys,

But most of all I'm your father and I'm just looking out for you,
When there's a problem, man I'm just looking out for you,

And what I'm about to do, you shouldn't go out and do,

Respect your elders, you grow to be good and strong,

You the reason, that I'm breathin',
And I will stop at any moment to see this, child live a better life,
Wow its a better life, but you better throw down if you ever fight,
Like Rocky do, don't be no punk when its time to get up and put on your boxing shoes,

"I don't feel the suns comin' out today
Its staying in, its gonna find another way.
As I sit here in this misery, I don't
Think I'll ever see the sun from here.

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say,
Hey look at him! I'll never live that way.
But that's okay
They're just afraid to change.

When you feel your life ain't worth living 
You've got to stand up and
Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
And when your deepest thoughts are broken, 
Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

And as we all play parts of tomorrow,
Some ways will work and other ways we'll play.
But I know we all can't stay here forever, 
So I want to write my words on the face of today.
And then they'll paint it

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and they'll say, 
Hey look at him and where he is these days.
When life is hard, you have to change.",5

Old timer want the block back, stop that
You been gone too long the young nigga said
Lord knows, what's goin through this young niggaz head
As the old timer stood and grilled him
Pissed off, shorty looked at his man
Touched his burner like I shoulda killed him
Shorty in deep, but hew don't care
But he don't know, these old timers don't play fair
There he go, postin on his strip again
Toast on him, niggaz wit 'em, posted on his shit again
(Uh-Oh) He actin like it can't and it won't happen
Old timer bout to blow dust off that old cabinet
(Thats,that's,Thats) Where dem guns is kept
These young niggaz better show some respect (respect)
I'll Teach 'em a lesson, he said to his self
As he proceeded to pull the lead from his shelf
Now he headed towards shorty block, forty cocked
On his zip, on his shit, like he don't care who shorty wit
But somebody saw him, before he go to shorty
Shorty phone ring, somebody called him
Somebody warned him, he's comin he's comin
Shorty replied, somebody stall him
Then he crept up wit his goons and guns
Whispered in to old timers ear, death is soon to come

[Chorus]
They say hell is hot,but is heaven cold
Know one ever knows til you Gone, gone, gone

And when you gone does ya soul drift off to a better place
Or do you jus float up and fade
Away,away,away,away, like a bird when its headed towards the sky (huh, huh)
Or do you just die (huh huh)
Or do you just perish from the earth and its over

Home girl ain't got a clue what he do for a livin
She jus think she got a dude wit a pension
She don't know dis dude is a henchman
And he move on dudes wit the cruelest intensions
All she know she got a brand new benz
And its big enough for her and all her brand new friends (Damn)
There she go, all through the street wit it
Dude in and outta towen, she all through the street wit it
We all know the street talk, we all know the street missin
Next thing she's missin....(music stops, phone rings twice)
""Hello"", ""Ay nigga I got yo bitch, have a million sent up or she dead""
Damn,she in deep shit, and she did nothin

Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)

"W-what is this, this sound like some graveyard shit
Well that's what the fuck they gon need
'Cause I'mma bury these niggas this time around

Who better than me, you better than me
Shit you never will see if you dead and deceased
Keep two', lead, and the piece and I'm busting it off right
Leave a trail of smoke like a fucking exhaust pipe
Took the coke up out the stash cause they know about the stash
Now I'm like swallow these dope up in the bags
Coke up in the bags, yeah sown up in the bags 
I do my chicks like Ludacris blow it out your ass
I'm a mean pimp you know what I mean pimp
Four hoes on each strip all bringing me chips
Futuristic, so when I'm gon they gon have to do ballistics 
Just to prove I'm this sick
You niggas need to be spank by your mami
For ever thinking you'll be greater than I'll be
You get that short late waist pack money 
I get that all straight a.s.a.p. money bring it here now!

[Chorus: x2]
Touch the coke, touch the pot, add the soda what you got me!
I am what I am I be what I be and that you will see I am crack!!

Who want it with I you want it with I 
I'll shoot one of ya eyes
You'll lose one of ya eyes
I'll jam move and slump ya
Leave your body in ranch cuckamonga with ants moving under
My flows so in order I can turn soap and water to ocean water and float the border
You never will be what I forever will be 
Your tombstone never will read we buried a G nope!!
I'm so mean and nice with the things I write 
Jesus might say Jesus Christ
It's only rap so why y'all trying to hold me back
Like y'all ain't ask for to owe me back I'm here!
My peoples play and sling cocaine
More than Billy Blanco from Carlito's Way
So you can find me on the streets okay 
With that big fucking piece okay

[Chorus: x2]

Too dope for this but you won't admit 
So my two's smoking spit make you choke on spit
You ever seen a man gag and gargle
Sound like a new born trying to ask for bottles 
They like cut it out you slacking
But I bust it out in rapping 
Can you name a nigga better without me busting out in laughing?
Nigga you couldn't spit enough to get at me 
I'll stretch ya for extracurricular activity
I'm more macing than grace is when I say shit
You should say amen after my name kid
Yes this is that of greatest
You should say amen after this statement

Nah
Yeah, yeah leave the hissin in, Don't take the hissin out
We gon keep this one all the way gangsta
I mean, you mutha fuckas don't realize, how real this shit is man
I mean, people always gonna try and get over on you
But protect what's yours, protect your family, protect what's right
Ya Dig! 

The story starts off, lil boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does it's back to the ghetto (ghetto)
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto
So he adapts the ghetto
Yes, the crack and the metal
He took no days off, for gettin this cocaine off
He ran back and forth so much he pissed Jose off
Now Jose was the cocaine boss
Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off 'cause' he had love for his sister
And shorty had no love for his sister 'cause' sister was sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for them both
'cause' he was good at handlin coke and Jose liked that
Problem was, he was pitchin for the dudes down the street
You know, Cj, Big Boo, and Meleke
Meleke was a killa, Boo was a killa
Cj, well he's just anotha nigga
Despite the fact, they didn't like the fact, that he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And bein that he was a bitch and he ain't know when its here
They set it up to get him there n hit him there
But shorty was smart, so before they got to load up n spark he said hold up my heart
Please, then he said Please, look up in my bag, there's cook up in my bag
It's all good up in my bag
And there's more where that came frome
It came from Jose, believe me there's more where that caine from
So they let him go thinkin he would tell them where Jose kept the heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that
And we all know Jose bout that
Next thing we know we see Jose slouch back
And he said there's no way out that
He said shoot em ima blow they house back
Next day Jose sent the 2-way out town
And next minute someone blew they house down
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side
So shorty called Jose, like listen, it's going down I need more cocaine
So they met up, it was a set up
Guess who? Cj, Meleke and Boo speed up
You shoulda seen the look on old man's face
You neva seen a look on no man's face
Told him no mans great, and it's no man's place
To fuck with no man's fam
And he said where's my sister before I kill you
The End

[Outro]
The story's over man (over man)
They all kinda end like that man, ya dig
You see, I told this story because I kinda feel like, every hood, everybody, everybody gotta lil boy fresh and them somewhere
Weither it's right next door, across the hall
Up the block, down the block, around the corner
I mean, you see, you see we all see the same shit, just through diffent eyes
You surprised? Don't be man, It's just real shit
Holla at ya boy dipset, AYE!",5
"[Chorus]
Boy let me show ya how to make that crack
How to spend that money how to make that back
Girl let me show how to hit that strip
How to get that dick don't give back lip
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
Go head do what you do make it work for ya

Put the coke in the pots whip it over the rocks
Ship it over the blocks it's movin' movin'

I don't let it sit quick I move the damn thang
I can show you how to mix that shit
How to get that shit how to twist that wrist
I can show you how to get back more
And the shit that you get back is just as raw
Girl I can show you how to hit that Ave
With that big fat ass and go get that cash
But you know you got to give back half
I'm somethin' like a pimp man go get that cash
Boy I don't play when it comes to money
I guess that's why I'm okay when it comes to money
I got two coups a truck and one four door
I can pick up all my hoes and have a one four org

[Chorus]

Copped ten sold five then I hide three
Baking soda residue I'm gone with the other two
Fuck a magic stick Jeezy got a magic wrist

Stack it up like Pringles all type of chips

Ugh, you can smell it through the wrapper
That's that shit nigga sit it in a pamper

I let 'em sit and air out or else you on them dampers
My lil brother got piff on them campers
We call him the N.O. capo
New Orleans that's what we ride for
We got Cash Money on the table layin' underneath the flo'
Shit it's like I got a pan how I heat the flo'
Aye but I really got a pan when I hit the blo
Shit aye this beat is so
Motherfuckin' G.I. Joe and the hydro

LIKE no one that's living shit (AYE)
Straight from the ground y'all you dig?
Close to where the groundhogs live
Where the police hound y'all kids
Arrest and give out long bids
From where they keep the four squeeze the four
Hustle all day in the streets so long
If the feds ever decide to come
We all going down for the motherfucking reaper law

[CHORUS]
I was taught be smart stay humble
I was taught be hard don't fumble
I was taught in these concrete jungle
Rumble young man rumble
I was taught stay hard as they come dude
I was taught any problems confront you

Rumble young man rumble

From my date of birth hun'
'Til my day in the dirt come

I'm here to promise to keep my vows in order
I'm here to promise to keep my child in order
'Til the day I get locked
'Til the day I get shot
Or till the day I just drown in water (AYE)

"[Intro]
Man, first I just wanna salute my soldiers
Knahmean? We just trying to stay above water
Feel me? I mean I speak for the Gs, the hustlers
They understand me, knahmsayin?
Shit
Lock into this time and lock out (always)
I mean ain't nothing promised to niggaz like us
You know?

[Juelz Santana]
Just a, another day another dollar
Now look what you got
Another hater, another plotter
Shit, you know the drill
A brother pay, a brother holla
Watch 'em, they creeping
Another raid, another copper
Aw man
Another case, another lock-up
What
Another bail, know that cake better pop up
Yup
That's just day to day shit we go through
And results of the day to day shits we go through
Some niggaz day to day pitch, they local, and
Some niggaz day to day bricks, they coastal, and
Some niggaz day to day snitch, they vocal
I don't honor them fools
Them type of dudes get they tonsils removed
I speak from the heart of the hood
From the boarded up apartments with wood
From the cracked down crack houses (yeah)
To the burnt up black houses
To fiends inside with that burnt up glass out
And puffing weed makes my actions switch
I'm at the window, with the pistol, like Malcolm
Ain't that a bitch (man)
And I'm paranoid, paranoid
But still I got to get it, got to have it, make it happen boy

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take
And may this song play all the way
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me

[Juelz Santana]
Look now
Another dead, another born
Vice versa
Another here, another gone
Pay attention
Another smile, another mourn
Another funeral, another baby shower going on
Get it, huh
That's just life in the hood
You earn scars, you earn stripes in the hood
Huh, get it
I live the life of a hustler
No sleep all night for a hustler, buster
And if your coke weak, cut it with Bo Peep sheep
I swear fiends will chase that high for four weeks
I'm still dealing with the day to day beef and
Stress, hunger, patience
The day to day basics
Yep, shit that we go through, you know
Shit
Look at the shit that we go through, you know
Niggaz come home, can't get jobs
Niggaz getting money, acting like they can't get robbed
And that don't mix

"Huh, okay, put the kids to bed
Put 'em to bed now
I said put 'em to bed now!
Do it!
Yeah, yeah

Grip to it, kick to it
Fuck that, spit to it
Sorry people, party people
This ain't kids' music
Nope
This is violence (violence, violence)
This is violence (violence)
Violence

The champ is back
Yup
This is my anthem track
Yup
This wasn't made for to dance or for your hands to clap
This that
Gutter, gutter motherfucker Ay
This that
Get your knife, time to gut a motherfucker Ay
They hand you the snub
Dismantle your mug
A head shot have you looking like you shampoo with blood
The vandalous thugs
The scandalous thugs
That go to your block, piss on the spot where your candle's put up
This ain't no damn push music
Or no hammish (?) music
This ain't party time it's army time
Ambush music
This that cripple fly, kill a guy, full blown gorilla-fied
Don't go in the club if you can't get your clip inside music
This that half a pound, back 'em down, ask around
Nobody say nuttin', cause they know they gon' get gatted down music
That pop and squeeze, lots of screams, guess what
Coppers, we ain't never forgot about Rodney King music

[Chorus]

Let's get ready to rumble (yup)
This that gritty, gritty for shizzy y'all (yup)
For shizzy, nizzy, I'll kill a nigga, he piss me off (Ay)
Heat him down, keep the pound, see him now, beat him down
I ain't talkin' 'bout a bush when I say he'll get beat around music
He ain't actin' right, grab and fight, stab him right
Show dude old school snatches at taxes night
Sip sizzurp, smoke weed, x up, coke, please
Dope fiends, get a load of this new codeine
That music, crack music, peel a nigga cap to it
No reason at all
This music is that stupid (Ay)
It's the code of silence (no it's)
Spoken silence
Right now I am promoting violence (Ay)
Why shouldn't I get the vest and spit the thing (Ay)
When y'all promote cigarettes and nicotine (Ay)
And y'all hope we stop it
Y'all told me stop it
Y'all the ones that keep promoting violence (Ay)

[Chorus]

This the shit that the gangstas love
Stomp out a gang of bud
Squeeze off a gang of slugs
We gotta vacate the club music
That's how the gangstas does
Shanking O.J., a thug
Go get your glock, and let it pop
Just like Bacon does music
We the few left that does what we do best
This here, get clear
Illegal in the U.S.
I overdosed the injection that leave you posted and deaded
This so gangsta, they can't make a radio edit
This that act correct, cause I ain't got to pack a Tec
I could just snap my hand and have a nigga snap ya neck
This the talk is cheap, so I let the luger speak
Pump the torch, then dump the corpse off in Dawson's Creek
The O.G. killer is back
So if you're living is whack
Come see me, little nigga, I'll give you a gat like
Here, here's a hammer nigga
Here, go hurt a nigga
Here, go jam a nigga
Here, go murk a nigga",5

Whatever you wanna call it nigga what's good
We riders, we rollers, we survivors, we soldiers
We don't crack under pressure

Most of all, we don't rap under pressure
We bang, and we pitch this crack

"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",5

Behold the fungus among us
When dabblin with babblin
I sends the battle scene to the apocalypse

Be gettin sorta puckery
Gettin the Brewin gassed to save that ass come stop the fuckery
My style'll leave ya posin like a hitch hiker
Make me want to bitch microphone slap that shady ass, you bullshit nigga
Your frontin said you didn't think too hot of me
But once you feel the vocal sodomy you'll say, ""You got it, G""
I finds the virgin ears I'm bustin raw pops
Ya savin the drops, tryin to analyze my DNA, the verbal blueprint
Even if you spend eternity you're baffled, nigga
Havin not the slightest clue of how I'm swingin
Bringin styles and flow that's nastier than urine
See my shit is pure and ghetto embellished demonic funk and all that good shit
A bad nigga when it comes to grabbin mics
I love all women of the spectrum, fuck around I'm stabbin dykes
And as I hurt em I convert em, when it comes to honey dip skits 
I'm leavin pussies sore as if you just delivered triplets, I flip shit 
When niggas say the brewin doesn't rhyme slick 
I yokes em in the Heimlich just to get the fuckin garbage out ya throat 
Mentally hardcore 
There be no guard for defendin against the shit I'm sendin 
Once you're comprehendin the ill funk aphrodisiac 
Givin the hoodies woodies as I'm fuckin up the head like brass knuckles givin noogies

Look under ""fat"" and you'll see my profile so smile 
You're grinnin like the Joker
Cause I chose to smoke a mic and let you witness 
Get this through your thick skull: my shit is deadly 
I kicks my verse, niggas couldn't offer competition with a medley of their works
I smirks when booty niggas try and grab this 
Survival of the fittest call me fuckin Tony Atlas, at the podium 
I pours my sodium in open flesh wounds as I mesh tunes with the vocal joint 
To become the focal point
Brothas of funk soon discover I be +deeper+ than that nigga Larry Fishburne's +cover+
Hover on the L, sorta like a stealth in the night
Then I makes the party +jump+ even when it's full of +white men+

Check it out
I represent enlightenment 
That have you squintin 
Hintin to rewards of the lord's charity received with clarity 
I heave skillaful syllable is the brick I stick in music mortar 
Makin ya think and raisin my floor to architect

I comes to spark a teck
Mind barrages massages carressed in peace 
The vocal acupuncture your stress released 
Like a hymen crack in my rhymin slack and never that 
Styles mysterious like under LL's hat

The curious become the furious and play the jury
Thus I'm found guilty labelin my sound filthy with the gutter in my utter 
A fat bitch goes, ""Me me me"" 
I cut her in pieces kill her sisters daughters and nieces 
Anything related to such a thought 
I crush I fought hard representin wicked Juggaknot minds 
I breaks it down to your English
I makes you say, ""I'm gooder"" 
Verbs deeper than a hooker strictly bonin seven footers

What y'all know about them wild niggas
Devil child niggas
Have-you-kick-the-bucket-say-fuck-it-and-smile-niggas
The type to catch the Buddha buzz, slide up to the fuzz
Sayin ""Officer, run your shotty before I catch this body""
I knew this nigga Smokey, sorta like his pistol
Barrel when you're in peril and shit like that was wanted
But later that would die down,
Sorta like many abandoned that he ran with
His block felt sorta haunted
His only solitude was wifey, word to life, G it seemed
They was together forever and now the womb had been seeded
He needed a job and the robbin wouldn't do it
He wasn't tryin to go out like Diquan in Strapped
Her mother was a nurse, her purse was chubby
From the hospital she found Smokey some work and shit was lovely
With some cream in here, feed a patient there, he had loot
And not a nigga on the street would have to get that pocket tapped
He's workin in maternity and learnin
Seein much about the infant children
To be skilled in fatherhood
Stealin baby stuff home for self
And he didn't have to pull the Mac-20 off the shelf and get...

Chorus:
Loose if a brotha can't take no more
Loose if a brotha can't swing it
Loose if a brotha can't break once more
Loose if a brotha.....

[Brewin]
In Maternity, Smokey saw stuff, raw stuff,
Make-you-drop-your-jaw-stuff, hospitals get sorta wild
He saw some babies shakin, awakin if they were fortunate
His soul was scorchin, it would have thinkin of his child
Later there would be no ""Honey, I'm home,""
Strictly ""Woman if you jeopardize my seed, dead up, I leave you wet up""
On the block, a flock of zombies entranced
By the peddlers of temporary ghetto heaven had him fed up
His job was gettin hard to fuck with
They had even had him stuck with the disposal of the stillborn
Poisoned by the nourishment, the ill torn soul from flesh
From the womb to tomb
Seein shit like that'll have you crazy
That night he had a dream
And it was a child nursin upon the semen of the glass genetalia
Clouded nut after clouded nut
He woke and shouted ""What the FUCK is goin on?""
Smokey was swayze, it's time to get....

Chorus

[Brewin]
He figured there was only one way
As he rushed the runway lookin wild deranged
This was common, without any qualm inside he was tookin
Lookin at fiends of the pebble adored praised,
Devil for lord raised from the crystallized tombs
Through fumes from the floor
Blazed the sole sacrificial altar
He chose now to halt the worship dealin that ultimate headrush... 

The lead crushed, buyer or seller decoratin hell a flame
With the choir of the firearms to blame
In the mornin by the time the smoke cleared,
Everybody seen the massacre, the local folk cheered
""Oh, thank the Lord Almighty,"" the pharmacy was out of business
On the L a chubby widow cries alone because her man had gotten...

Chorus (2x)",5
"I declare war 
The joy becomes a rappifyin' weapon 
If you step in 
When your draws get mobbed behind enemy lines
You become a sittin' duck but fuck 
I ain't givin' 'em livin' trifle 
The pen and pad becomes a 12 gauge rifle 
This is no laughing matter 
Step into this you step in a minefield 
Your body's scattered 
You people drop pickin' up the pieces 
But only corny niggas 
The attack from a brotha like the Buddy never ceases 
Without a moment of silence the violence thickens
So if you ain't got it together you slim pickings 
Shorts and prisoners are never taken 
If you fakin' all the booty competition 
I'm a bag fuck a white flag 
Get down and dirty like a brotha in the trench 
Leave a nigga dead and stinkin' as he wonders what his stench is 
I'm bustin' clip after clip 
My artillery will funk on the punk 
When ya want to test my shit

Tell it to hell is it
I feel my brain swell like meningitis 
With the slightest mind motion 
Givin' me the notion
That I got it bad 
I think I got a brain tumor 
Brain rumor 
Such a pain to analyze the strain and then understand it
The seed was planted
That shit is ill but still 
The thought I'm lovin' got the dome growin' 
With the biscuit in the oven 
Shovin' nothin' but the nutrients 
My diet to support me
A whiff of the spliff 
A guzzle of the forty to inspire fire thought
To the mic there was marriage
Causin' competition 
Verbal miscarriage of the mental fetus 
Greet us with the rugged rhythm then I'm showin'
I think I feel my water breakin' thus I'm flowin'
Timin' my contractions 
Concentratin' on my breathin'
Heavin' curses at the father he has the funk 
'Cause if I flunk my shit ain't livin'
Pushin' givin' every bit of what I'm worth 
And as the Brewin' drops the lyrical 
The miracle of birth

I be the sick ass brotha, nasty ass nigga 
A phony motherfucker grave digga 
I know this sounds rough 
But I had enough to funk 
So part of me the heart of me
So if you corny nigga 
It's like cloggin' up my artery 
You cuttin' circulation 
So now it's do or die 
While niggas always try to test my shit
Only preservation of the funk is why I kick this
As I give a simple diagnosis of the sickness

Now upon the fruits of my labor 
Your ear feasts 
The beast from within 
It's some shit ain't it
The picture painted 
From the use of a noun and a verb might disturb 
We make you say, ""Damn that nigga's crazy"" 
Well if we crazed, deranged well then we fittin'
If you say the world's a normal place
Who the fuck you kiddin'?
Your mind's blind if you say you haven't seen this
As I walk the fine line between insanity and genius",4
"I saw the splendor of the moonlight
On Honolulu Bay
There's something tender in the moonlight
On Honolulu Bay

And all the beaches are filled with peaches
Who bring their ukes along
And in the glimmer of the moonlight
They love to sing this song

If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you
If you like to linger where it's shady
Ukulele Lady linger too

If you kiss Ukulele Lady
While you promise ever to be true
And she sees another Ukulele
Lady foolin' 'round with you

Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)
Maybe she'll find somebody else
By and by

To sing to when it's cool and shady
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo
If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you

She used to sing to me by moonlight
On Honolulu Bay
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight
Although I'm far away

Some day I'm going, where eyes are glowing
And lips are made to kiss
To see somebody in the moonlight
And hear the song I miss

If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you
If you like to linger where it's shady
Ukulele Lady linger too

If you kiss Ukulele Lady
While you promise ever to be true
And she sees another Ukulele
Lady foolin' 'round with you.

Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)
Maybe she'll find somebody else
By and by

To sing to when it's cool and shady
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo
If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you",5
"Tu hi tu hai meri jaan
Tu hi tu hai meri jaan

Lately things don't seem
The way they used to be 
Between you and me
Girl I'm missing you

You say I'm never home
Chasing my own goals
And you just don't know
That it's all for you

Don't you understand
I'm trying to be a better man
And all I do, I do for you
Baby heart in hand, I'll give you everything I can
Girl if you can only see

Ek gal tu sun meri jaan
(Hear me out, my soul mate, my life)
Meri manla hun meri jaan
(Believe me, my life)
Mere dil na thoo meri jaan
(Don't break my heart, my life)
Tu hi tu hai meri jaan
(You and only you are my life)

I would give it all up
Give it all up
Give it all up for you
I would give it all up
For you

Really want to spend some quality time
Hey girl I really want to show ya
Need a little time to make it right

Hey girl I really want to show ya
Really want to spend some quality time
Hey girl I really want to show ya
Need a little time to make it right

"Am I happy, maybe not
But I never want to lose what I got
I wouldn't trade it for anything dear to my heart, oh no

You take the good times with the bad
How else would you know happy from sad
Sooner or later
You're gonna have to finally look back

And you'll look back and see
What happened in between
And you'll appreciate
Each and every single day

[Chorus]
The pop of the cork
And the cling of the glasses
We toast to the future
And we drink to the past
It might not be easy 
But nevertheless
These are the best days (of our lives)

Sometimes the weather can be rain
But one day it will be sunny again
Without the clouds of life
It's just another sunny day

[Chorus]

These are the times
That I will never forget
These are the best days (of our lives)

And you'll look back and see
What happened in between
And you'll appreciate
Each and every single day

It might not be easy 
But nevertheless 
These are the best days (of our lives.)",6
"Sunny day 
Sweepin' the clouds away 
On my way to where the air is sweet 

Can you tell me how to get, 
How to get to Sesame Street? 

Come and play 
Everything's A-OK 
Friendly neighbors there 
That's where we meet 

Can you tell me how to get 
How to get to Sesame Street? 

It's a magic carpet ride 
Every door will open wide 
To happy people like you
Happy people like 
What a beautiful 

Sunny Day 
Sweepin' the clouds away 
On my way to where the air is sweet 

Can you tell me how to get

"Wake up in the morning with a head like 'What ya done?'
This used to be the life but I don't need another one
Good luck cuttin' nothin', carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

So I play along when I hear that favorite song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You better know when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like magic's solely yours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with the one in bed till dawn with you, you, you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colors make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clapped your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that you'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one if I can't get down with you, you, you

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer light

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one if I can't get down with you, you, you",6

Cards he ain't showing

Just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby
Just call me angel of the morning, (angel)

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
And it won't matter anyhow

And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

"Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
As the village children fight each other for their share
And the six-o-nine goes roaring past the creek
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really doing fine for eighty-four
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort in a heart that's going back home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen
Hey but that ain't natural old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Country comfort in a heart that's going back home",6

To drink from the river 'til the river ran dry

The river ran dry and it broke his heart

Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Many are the times that he called his love
Called her to his side 'til he had enough
Then came a wind to blow her away
Never did he drink from the river that day

River of love, river of love
Drink from the river, fly like a dove
The river runs long, the river runs free
But the river of love never runs to me

Pricked by a thorn and heart will bleed
Red as a rose for the world to see
Chained by time to the river side
A fool will drink 'till the river runs dry

Drink from the river, fly like a dove

In the release two prisoners are free from the darkness 
One more escape surviving the heartache and madness

knowing it ain't really smart

thinking 'bout a life of crime

to keep me away from you

But when they're handing out the heartaches
you know you got to have you some

But hide your heart beneath the covers
and tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart

"Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart
I'm hurt much more than you'll ever know
Hurt because I still love you so
But even though you've hurt me like no one else could do
I would never, never hurt you
 
Hurt to think that you lied to me
Hurt way down deep inside of me
You said your love was true and we'd never part
Now you want someone new and it breaks my heart

Hurt because I still love you so

But I really don't know what to say
The operator wont let me talk at all
And she says you want me to pay
Oh well it ain't nothin new
It fits right with my picture of you
But tonight you're gonna find out
What these tears are all about

[Chorus]
'Cause this old flame went out
You never thought you'd be the one
In the darkness now
I think you know what I'm talkin about
This old flame went out

You went to get cigarettes
That was last July, you didn't get home yet
And now you expect me to hear you out
You call me collect, there ain't no doubt

What do you mean, how can I do this to you? 
Lets not forget who walked out on who

"Well I don't know why I came here tonight
I've got a feeling that something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I don't know how I'll get down the stairs

Well it's clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you

And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to keep this smile on my face
When I'm going all over the place

Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you

When you started off with nothing
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your family comes all crawling
Slaps you on the back and saying
Please, please

(Repeat)
Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor
I don't think I can take anymore

Well, clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Here I am stuck in the middle with you
Yes I am stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, stuck in the middle with you
Ooh, stuck in the middle with you",5

That Old Sleep Still In Your Eyes
I Remember All The Laughter
And The Tears We Shared Last Night

And I Have Never Been Afraid Of Losing
And I Have Never Wanted Love To Be A Chain
I Only Know That When I'm With 
You You're My Sunshine, You're My Rain 
The Sweetest Thing I've Ever Known Is Loving You

Now You And I, We're Not Children 
We Have Both Been Loved Before 
We Have Given And We Have Taken 
Many Rides On Troubled Shores 
And All The Heartaches And Temptations 
Only Make Me Love You More 
The Sweetest Thing I've Ever Known Is Loving You",6

She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever

How am I doin'? Well, I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday
It ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
What if I remember that's the same thing that you told me it was lonely yes
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

I gotta go now 
I guess I'll see you somewhere around
You don't know, you'll never know, we don't know, you can't know when 
I'll be back in town
Maybe tomorrow, please remember
What I told you, told you, that entire time you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time slips away

Oh, what I want you to do is just remember, just remember, what I told you
And time, time, you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

One day I want you to do
Just remember, remember, what I told you
And time, time
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slipped away

It's the same thing, same thing, that you told me

"All alone at the end of the of the evening
And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money

You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?

And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
For more

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time",6

That old sleep still in your eyes

And the tears we shared last night

In the light before the dawn

Is loving you

And I have never been afraid of losing
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

Now, you and I, we're not children
We have both been loved before
We have given and we have taken
Many rides on troubled shores

And all the heartaches and temptations
Only make me love you more
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

And I have never been afraid of losing
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain

To stay so dark, so close to the light

To the hopeless romance inside
Shout it's all right, it's all right
To stay so dark, so close to the light

Thumbin' through a check, got me sweatin' and pantin'
When you getting money chicks come around
Niggas start hatin' who's holdin' you down
All this ice I'm just livin' the life
Bad bitches want me, give me head like lice
Hit club LIV in a rush
Pockets so swole I think they finna bust
Ace in my hand and a .45 tuck
Money coming down codeine pourin' up
Smokin' on some dope, always on a float
20 years in niggas callin' me the G.O.A.T
Money adding up you haters going broke
Still in the game while you niggas ridin' old
See me showin' out they muggin, I don't give a fuck
How I start my morning off, a zip and a double cup
Hating ass niggas, y'all behind me

Gettin' rich, band-tastic, white girls like Anne Hatha-
Way going, way out, they wait for my bandwagon
She let me bang and I ain't got a bandana
Ooh (Freaky) that's just how I move
Fast girls, fast money, no more fast food
Came up first class, my passport gettin' tattooed (boi)
Young ass playa doing everything that I have to

Every time I go out, you know I gotta show out
Every time I go out, you know I bring the dough out
Every time they go out, you know they bring they ho out

Got my niggas with me, they came with them yoppers
Got a few ratchets, even a couple models

She needs wings on her
I might have to put a ring on her

So I had to stop her, tell that bitch to keep it movin'
Money right in front of her, but she don't know what she viewin'

See niggas taking shots but I'm so bulletproff
I just laugh at 'em, couple Bentley coupe
I swear I be so high I gotta loose the roof
See niggas got a lackers, they know I'm the truth
See where I'm from nobody gives a fuck about you
I know rappers, I know trappers, I know real clappers
If you ain't getting money nigga then you hustle backwards
Choppers on the backseat if you want some action

They playing tough but they ain't saying much about the captain
My niggas bout that action
You (?) your bitch heard about the thing I'm packing

No day moving past us, niggas moving backwards
I ain't worried bout the pussy I'm just wondering where the cash is
I just do it different, I just made my cake the fastest
If a nigga tripping get a thing and then we blast it
I just rolled some weed and fucked your bitch, thats why I'm laughing

"I walked 47 miles on barbed-wire, 
Cobra-snake for a necktie. 
Built a house by the roadside, 
Made of rattlesnake hide.

Made out of human skulls.

Tell me who do you love? 

Who do you love, now? 
Who do you love, now? 
Who do you love, babe? 
I say: Who now, who do you love? 

Tombstone head and a graveyard mind, 
Just 22 and I don't mind dying. 
Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip, 
Come on baby don't give me no lip. 

Who do you love, now? 
Who do you love? 
Who do you love, child? 
I said: Who, baby, who do you love? 

Night is dark, the sky was blue, 
Down the alley the ice wagon flew. 
Hit a bump, somebody screamed, 
Should'a heard just what I seen. 

Do you love me, babe? 
Do you love her, yeah 
Do you love me, babe? 
Do you love it, yeah

Well, who, baby, who do you love? 
What do you love, now?

"There's a dead man hanging, slumped over the steering wheel of an interstate
Runaway bursting into flames
And the devil was gently breathing, sleeping face-down in my
Apartment, and like all his friends I'm growing tired of his games...

And there's a homeless man arranging his hands, grooving to the beat
Radiating from a police scanner, who said ""The air was feeling good to
Me, just as cool and ripe as air can be,"" and a woman who sincerely
Believes in UFOs and who can blame her when the stars are hanging
Overhead, dangling by a thread, floating ten thousand feet off the ground...

(This was a story told to me when I was just the age of 17, one which
God himself dictated to me, he said, ""This is how all this shits gonna
Be when I blow your little planet into smithereens."" It haunted my
Dreams like an accident on reply on a TV screen.)

She sees faces in her dreams--strange machines she'd never seen
Blueprints of submarines to reassemble in a time of dire need
And there were preachers in the desert, waving to the crowd
Dictating seven angry letters from a man up in the clouds

And there were 27 soldiers telling 27 lies
And a hole inside a hurricane with a pair of beady eyes
A pair of beady eyes looking down onto the pavement while the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all will want a front seat when shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova turned the other way around!

There were strangers in the subway and men in limousines making deals and
Swapping photographs of cans of gasoline, and there are no angels in the woodwork
Or devils on the ground, and they are looking through a hurricane's tectonic wall of
Sound and a man who smokes his cigarettes the other way around and she is looking
In behind him from inside a wall of sound and she is dancing with the neon because
The air is feeling good against her arms and legs and fingertips are measuring the
Distance in the spaces in between me and you and all your friends when there's no
Time to load a weapon and no time to make amends and people frozen in their tracks
Staring at the sky at a hole inside a hurricane revealing...

A pair of beady eyes!
A pair of beady eyes looking down onto the pavement while the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all will want a front seat when shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova turned the other way around!

This is not a test, this is the real thing...
This is not a test, this is the real thing...

To invite everyone I've known
Dead and alive
To a street where we can be
Finally free

Wearing their hearts on their sleeves, oh no
How good it felt to have them worn
Just like they should

And everybody here wants to know
Did everybody say what a good day that it was
For everybody here who said what a good day it was?

Did they smile 'cause they like it, 
Did they smile 'cause they like it,

Running circles around ourselves

To be young and loved
And feel it in our bones

That it felt like this, we were never told
That it felt like this we were never told
And it scares us bad so we'll have to be bold
But there's still one thing that we need to know.

But she can't recall his face
She hears knocking on her door at night
But he never leaves a trace

Repeated again and again in her dreams:

A muffled scream, and a broken fall as the moonlight streams in from down the
End of the hall, it's just the stars stooping down to sing their goodbyes while a
Man with a briefcase and hollowed out eyes spoke...

Over and over again...
Over and over again...

Of secrets that you may keep

You want Hollywood,
And this is real life

I want to kiss to you in the pouring rain,
I say I loved you from the first
Time I saw you
It's a sure fire way to get you hard to break,
That's Hollywood,
And this is real life

You want Hollywood,
And this is real life",7
"Seems like many years ago
It's strange how you can never know who's
Going to stay with you and who will leave
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?

We walk through the park at night
Gazing up at all the satellites
(Lights) in the city made it hard to see
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?

On that night, long ago
Walking down the road that we used to know
You said, ""Let's take it slow""
Let's take the long way home
Let's take the long way home

One day further down the road
With full grown children of your own
If I passed by you on a busy street,
Will you remember me?
Will you remember me?

On that night, long ago
Walking down the road that we used to know
You said, ""Let's take it slow""
Let's take the long way home
Let's take the long way home

One day down the road you'll find
Everything you hid inside
Caught beneath the ocean,
Searching for a sign of life

One day down the road you'll find
Something that you kept inside
Caught beneath the ocean
A part of us is still alive

One day down the road you'll find
Everything you hid inside

On that night, long ago
Walking down the road that we used to know
You said, ""Let's take it slow""
Let's take the long way home
Let's take the long way home",5

Are you waiting on a lightening strike
Are you waiting for the perfect night

What are you waiting for
Don't you wanna learn to deal with fear
Don't you wanna take the wheel and steer
Don't you wait another minute here

Are you waiting for the right excuse?
Are you waiting for a sign to choose

Don't you wanna really live your life?
Don't you wanna love before you die?

Everybody needs a leap of faith

"Maybe the sky isn't falling,
Maybe it's all in my head.
Maybe the world isn't dangling off the edge.

But the feelings the same,
In fact it feels like a trap,
Set by someone who wants for my heart to collapse.

So can we take a moment and stop?

'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, who falls for you
(Oooh x2)

Maybe the world isn't ending,
Maybe its been postponed.
I've got a feeling it's happening all on its own.

They say that love is contagious,
But I don't know about that.
'Cause broken hearts are the easiest part to give back.

So can we take a moment and stop?

'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, who falls for you
(Oooh x2)
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, who falls for you

The clock is out,
The timer's up,
And I've got nowhere to go.
Take my pride,
Take my friends,
Just don't take my heart.

I don't think I can take it,
Another heartbreaking,
Another whole world crumbling in two.
I'm sick of the endings,
And I'm sick of beginnings,
Of anyone who stumbles into view.

'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one

'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, who falls for you

"Her turn signal blinked to the east
Towards the long wooden pier that hangs over the beach
She took off her dress
And she walked towards the sea
And thought maybe it could sweep away me

His engine turned off with the keys
As he ran towards her, he fell to his knees
He said what have I done wrong
He said what did I forget
She looked away and she wept

He said why don't you show me where it hurts
Why don't you show me where it hurts
He said why don't you show me where it hurts
Where it hurts the most

She said it follows me wherever I go
I wake up each morning and the darkness unfolds
Yeah I just cant fake it
Everything's like a choir
And I cant live like this anymore

He said why don't you show me where it hurts
He said why don't you show me where it hurts
He said why don't you show me where it hurts
Where it hurts the most

All alone
Love is gone in darkness
Cold as a stone
Searching through the shadows you have known
Love's gone
Bare as a bone.

Trying to hold the memory face
You seem to have vanished without a trace
And in this darkness
This empty space
I float alone.

Now the night is falling
You have gone
Sad dreams blow through dark trees
Love's gone wrong
Clouds of sadness raining all night long
Love's gone
The end of our song.

I float alone
I float alone.

And the way you sang it to me
So many times in other forms
On distant lands.

You and me
It can't be real

Do you remember our picnic lunch?
We both went up to the lake
And then we walked among the pines
The birds sang out a song for us
We had a fire when we came back
And your smile was beautiful
You touched my cheek and you kissed me
At night we went for a stroll
The wind blew our hair
The fire made us warm
The wind blew the waves
Out on the lake
We heard the owl in a nearby tree.
I thought our love would last forever.",6

Flow like they did when I saw
The dying swan

In the night.

Then your smile died
On the water
It was only a reflection
Dying with the swan.

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Then he came and sat down at my table,
And as he placed his hands over mine,
I found my self wanting to kiss him 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and he whispered, ""I need you!""
""Let me take you away and be your man.""
Then I looked into his eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.",5

Love is feeling, feeling love
Love is wanting to be loved 

Love is touch, touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love
Love is asking to be loved

You and me

We can be 

Love is free, free is love
Love is living, living love
Love is needing to be loved",8
"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",7

A deep shade of blue is always there

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky

When you're without love

Emptiness is the place you're in
Nothing to lose, but no more to win

The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Lonely
Without you
Baby
Oh, I need you
I can't go on

The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes

There's a new girl hanging out with you
I'd kill the messenger
But she's my friend and I love her
And I know she tells me this for my own good
'Cause she knows I've not moved on
Like a wise girl should

Now she's lying in my place
With the right to kiss my favourite face
Now she's curled up in my chair
Your fingers in her hair
It's more than I can bear

I do the best I can
To go along with God's good plan
He thinks it's obvious
There's no hope for the two of us
So I know he's doing this for my own good
'Cause she knows I've not moved on
Like a wise girl should

Now she's lying in my place
With the right to kiss my favourite face
Now she's curled up in my chair
Your fingers in her hair
It's more than I can bear

Some may say life is for living
But this takes some forgiving
And I will try to

Now she's lying in my place
With the right to kiss my favourite face
Now she's curled up in my chair
Your fingers in her hair
It's more than I can bear

Under you over you outside you
I have been happy in my thinking

Drive me to the mountains
Take me to the sea
You be strong and beautiful
And I'll try not to be me
With my complications
With my don'ts and dos
You be kind and wonderful
And I'll be good to you

If you feel brave and you ask me I'll say
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Safe beneath these clean white sheets I dream
I'm under you over you outside you
I have been happy in my dreaming

Kiss me in the morning
Hold me though the night
Whisper that it's okay
And I'll believe you're right
Steer me from the shadows
Lead me to the light
Push your hand in my hand
And I won't put up a fight

If you feel brave and you ask me I'll say
Stay, stay, stay, stay

Under you over you outside you
Stay, carry me away

When love appears over the horizon

We make plans but then love demands a leap of faith
So hold me close and never never let me go
'Cause even though we think we know which way the river flows
That's not the way love goes, no

On Woodland Avenue
The youngest of eight children
With a voice that soared and soothed
Singing at the Lincoln Center
The church a block away
Like a perfect angel
As the Red Sanders Band played

She said, ""Baby
Can we just go some place warm
And stay there ?til the baby's born?
I'll be your roadside angel
And walk with you through life""

She was his roadside angel
He was her guiding light
They drove south from New York city
To Gainesville, Florida
And settled for two summers
There with Marc and Maya

He loved her from the moment he saw her
At the top of the electric theatre stairs
Wrapped in his loving arms she lay
Listening to Stevie she flew away
She flew away

Stretching over mountains
Across the sea

Through the barren plains

Binds me to you
An electrical undetectable current
Charging over mountains
Across the sea
Every star lights the path to you from me
Under deserts
Through the barren planes
Connecting you to me again
No matter where you are
No matter no matter how far

My rose tinted glasses are incredible
Blinding me to the inevitable
Coloring my judgment like a jumbo pack of pens
Like the ones you buy for birthday's
For children of your friends

My inner guide was screaming look out beware
I silenced Miss Righteous with one stony glare
Figuring what would she know anyway
Yet thanks to her I'm standing her
Defiantly today

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

My white flag was flying in the wind
Though you had no heard for surrendering
On we marched regardless for reason's still unknown
Sometimes the wrong thing
Seems so much better than being alone

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

Is this a good time to mention
Some where contemplating
An earthly intervention
We're all blessed with 20/20 hindsight
You're just another thing
I didn't quite get it right

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

Seems no matter how I try
My Jacob's ladder in the sky
Has all the fallen angels climbing down

Cross my heart and hope to live
Number one on my wish list
If the angels get here they'll come round

To stop me pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
I would give the shirt off my back
I'd gladly make a deal
With any of the angels to change how I feel

I would hand over my soul
I'd relinquish all control
To any of the angels climbing down

Not fourteen more years of this
Stranded in the wilderness
If the angels get here send them round

To stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
I would give the shirt off my back
I'd gladly make a deal
With any of the angels to change how I feel

It's not like I've stolen someone else's blessing
Love's still blind and maybe that's the lesson

Stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
Stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still

I'd gladly make a deal

Thanks for being soft and kind
For making me change my mind
About everyone and everything
Boxed in this corner of mine
You walked across my borderline
And reached the girl that used to be me

When I was brave
Fearless, alive and unsaved
When I was free
Of all these black lined boundaries

Avoiding any fire and smoke
Safety first is all she wrote
Barricading up the open doors
Headed for the comfort zone
And settled for a life alone
Looking back locked in the ivory tower

To when I'd jump in
Not wondering if I would sink or swim
When I would dare
To move an inch without a single care

Before I invented
Perfect me
Perfect me
Perfect me

Thanks for being sweet and strong
For making me feel I belong
To the land of the living

Like when I was brave
Fearless, alive and unsaved
When I was free
Of all these black lined boundaries

Before I invented
Perfect me

No one I can see you yeah in my eyes to your heart 
I see you 
I can see with my eyes you know a lot to
I can see with my eyes you know a lot to 

I can see with my eyes you know a lot to 
I can see with my eyes you know a lot to",5
"In this very room
We spent the day and looked over antiquities
Don't you remember?

Do I know you?
I can't recall this face, but I want to

In this very room, we flew across the sea
In the ship Saturnia
Don't you remember?

I can't remember your face
But I hope the ship will carry us there
In the ship Saturnia",6
"I gave you a statue
Wonder why they're so still on label
Could it be
Talk to me to be bull or
Ten signs that read silence
Ten signs that read silence
Ten signs to
Possible to say
Ten signs that read silence
So born skin
Impossible to say
Ten signs that read silence
Frozen green, what's life
Impossible to say
I can't hear
Oh, oh, oh
Talk to me
The human whispers so cold
A few more sights
Don't be
The human whisper so cold",4
"All of us have moved on
From the author that we lived in
Too late to moved on
Hear to call your name
If you come for our sorrows
If you call out call out call out 
Needing is the best start
Early morning look out
Dizzy from the call your name
Want to want to want to
Birds are singing loud all around us
Call up call up call up
I will follow if you call out call out call out
I will follow you
If you call out call out call out
I will follow you
If you call out call out call out
I will follow you",6
"We are moved by your radiance
I have brought you this gold crown
I spliced its flowers together
Only the bees looking for flowers in spring go freely through the cool grass
Your voice is distinct in my ears
Now blessed lady, take this
Embellish your gold hair
No man alive approaches my good luck to ride with you
Though your face I never see
may my love go throughout life
as strong at the finish as now
at the turning point
This comes from a faithful hand",7
"A rock there is where, as they say, the ocean dew distills
And from its beetling brow, there pours a copious stream for pitchers to be dipped therein
'T was here I had a friend washing robes of purple in the trickling stream
And she was laying them out to dry on the face of a warm and sunny rock
From her I heard the tidings
See, here the wretched sufferer comes
His youthful flesh and golden hair have lost their beauty
Oh, what pain
What double grief has fallen on these halls and swooped on them from heaven",5
"So lillies, so tenderly when my dreams reflect them
Seeming fragrant, ah
Were sun in their grief
Your white of the dream
Unbinding my hands with my head
While enclosed in your violet grace
So lost, boredom and fountains
Wickedly, eyes
When will they turn around?",3
"Try to make yourself a work of art like me you can't
See?
Only me
What your mind, so sound and safe, cannot know
This was my plot",7
"My first thought was
There are so many days of rain
In Mexico City
A good reason to go
You know I love to run away from sun

Is it time to dance?
I'll fall you know I like to fall
I'm hopeful for
The rush hour car
Stares and
The memory of your piano

Can I feel you? Are you
Mythological?

Figures pass so quickly
That I realize my
Eyes know very well
It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for
In my raincoat

The time change worked well
I had a good excuse for being late
But I pushed open the door
The room was empty all the people gone

When the cab pulled up
I laughed, I forgot where I was going
There I stood mystified
I could give no reason for my frozen stare

Am I heading toward you?
It's a hot day
Can I feel you? Are you
Mythological?

Figures pass so quickly
That I realize my
Eyes know very well
It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for
In my raincoat

All these perfumes
In this parking lot
Thousands of people pass through
On the festival day
Playing their saxophones
I see a flashing light
I'm blinded by the possibility",6
"I'll take my time here, there's no reason to rush
I'd even let the cattle ride away--I wouldn't blink an eye
No I wouldn't blink an eye

He walks by me painting a freeway to go far
But I ride his motorcycle round and round him twenty times
I go nowhere twenty times

Oh, every time I do put on boots
I feel the charge like I've a good thing to run to
But I only hear the rattlesnake winds
They blow dust and I'm helpless to fight back

Can you bring me
A fresher perspective please?
Should I be a prouder conqueror
Just bathing in the light?

Oh true it's brighter than
Sky we left years ago
I'll take a photograph and pass it by my eyes
Everytime
I decamp so wearily

Oh, every time I do put on boots
I feel the charge like I've a good thing to run to
But I only hear the rattlesnake winds
They blow dust and I'm helpless to fight back",6
"Shake me awake!
Am I the man you see
Through your mystery eyes?
Oh yea, I second that emotion

You'll see lightning cascading
Pronouncements of our love

Lady of gold, you would fit beautiful in my wilderness
In your waters I've dropped anchor

You'll see lightning cascading
Pronouncements of our love

Tell me, why do I feel you running away?",7
"Sally, things close early
It's a holiday
They tell me

How long
Have you lived here?
Have you seen
The river?

Do you know the proper way
To ask for a cigarette?

I'm asking before winter comes

Stay here with me 'til morning
With the three-man orchestra playing
I ask a fortune teller
What they whisper when
I walk by

Do you know the proper way
To ask for a cigarette?
I'm asking before winter comes

All the people run from the horizon
All the people run from the horizon
All the people run from the horizon
All the people run from the horizon
All the people run from the horizon
Staying late, waking late, on the horizon
All the people run from the horizon",5
"Late nights in Lake Park
I wait for you to see me
My eyes open, standing watch for hours
Wearing your favorite thing

I awoke pleasing you so slowly
I'm giving you time
The soft light
On your man brow
I'm asking you to show me how

Show me now
Show me a second face
Show me how you make
Your second face

Fingers situate themselves in dark,
Moving the way that is so easy
And in summer bright your shout
On the surface, warm

I throw a box full of oranges,
Syrup seeping out
Searching for a season smell
I run from you then walk back to you
Who I don't know
Sniffing for a light

Show me now
Show me a second face
Show me how you make
Your second face

What did I do to make you feel so bad?
What did I do that you would make me feel so bad?",5
"Tonight the birds are watching me
Do they have more important things to do?
What of hearts in diamonds?
Oh I don't understand
I don't understand

Into Maxim's we will see them walk
Will they eat a piece of cheese or will they talk?
When they're loud enough we can hear their words
By night we are inquisitory birds
Some nights we are asked if we ever tire
Of gazing at their heels and everyday desires
Remember every dewy tale written of their loves?
Compare them to the ones they touch in front of us

We do not dance a story for you
Gil Blas bored whispers awakening the beast in me
Go!
Find your feet
Drink some blood
Say it to my face
If you want to be starting something
If you want to be starting something",5
"Betsy on the roof
I can't send the rain down, baby 
I can't send the rain down anymore

""Uh oh!"" she said, ""Uh oh""
""Uh oh!"" she said

What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?

Moon and emotion
Elsewhere is my name now
We don't dim the lights down anymore

""Uh oh!"" she said
""Uh oh!"" she said, ""Uh oh""
""Uh oh!"" she said

My arms stretched out, looking up
Won't you please tell me the answer?
You know the answer, Betsy

I'm standing here on the ground, Betsy
My arms stretched out, looking up
Won't you please tell me the answer?
You know the answer, Betsy

"Let me tell you about
Faces I see

The stately, the rugged
Under dirt
And sun umbrellas
Their eyes on the gun

Some puppy eyes
Some fierce lady eyes
Some warm gentleman eyes
But some eyes
That can't look into mine
Look into mine

""Bandido""
They call me
No one knows the story
I hate an imperious glance
In the gold country

I'm writing her a love song
How we fall into a dream in the rocks
Our rocks
They found me there
Chased after me
I crawled away quickly
Wasn't sure if i was lost or if I was running away again
Up what you now call the fourteen
I was a runner up the fourteen
Their mouths move
Say they wanna be the good guys
They wanna be triumphant

They put me to sleep
On diagonal rocks
So no one knows the story
I hate an imperious glance
In the gold country
In the gold

No one knows the story
Of ""Bandido""
In the gold country
""Bandido""
No one knows the story
I hate an imperious glance
In the gold country
In the gold country",5
"So
In this late hour
Maybe trouble
Maybe fantasy
It's too hot for winter
Patience, violent heart

Bright blue flames under my fingers
I'm taken by surprise
Taken through the city
Storm on my back

It is the hand of love so rough
What we're feeling for the first time?
Does Claire love too, or Julie? Do they love?
When Lis feels the way I do
Can I feel her percuss through the city?

Through the city
All the phones are ringing 
with the restaurant's complaint
Even the regular customers have left early tonight
Walked out without a hat
Everyone has left early without a hat
A fire without a hat

All the birds of the world make their way over
With new softer songs to sing
All the birds of the world make their way over
With new softer songs to sing

The moon is true
Maxim's on fire
Gigi swimming
Oh, I see my love swimming
Moon, you know disaster from a warm bath

All who are muffled by the squall
Doesn't love scare them?
Screamers on the balconies
Trombones on the roofs
The screamers who fell in love or died
City appearing",6
"I call my name aloud
Looking for what I remember
My name I know
I love going to the movies

I turn and see my childhood home
On this new beach where strange bird fly
These birds swoop right over
Looking out for me

""Who is she?""
""Where does she come from?""
The birds sang so loud

""Oh she's been marooned, oh
Can anybody help her?""

""Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?"" (oh)

""Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?""

The sun comes up
Slower than I remember
A man I know
He lights his cigarette with nothing
Not a smile or memory
His shadow still wet as my gash against the the rock
Sharp and high on the Balearic promontory
I see his ship go
What stings me?
These birds can't stop the waves

""Oh she's been marooned, oh
Can anybody help her?"" (oh)

""Oh she's been marooned (oh)
Can anybody help her?"" (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

The birds can sing a song
""He covered me in cactus""
The birds can sing a song
""I don't remember much but""
The birds can sing a song
""He turned me around""
The birds can sing a song
""My mouth quivered""
The birds can sing a song
""It's 4 am""
The birds can sing a song
""The man is gone""
The birds can sing a song
""The man is gone""
The birds can sing a song
""Good riddance, he is gone""
""His billhook caught their eyes""
""Blood is on his billhook""
""His billhook caught my neck""
""How unnaturally I gaze""
""How unnaturally I gaze""
""I gaze at nothing""
""I gaze at nothing""
""My emerald is gone""
""He lifts my hand""
""He lifts my hand""
""I hear him""
""I hear him""

I don't know much but

"I don't need no one to follow, feathers full
Get up early just to charm unawakened souls
When the sea called me
When the sea called me home

I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear

It's no wonder they're shipping all my clothes
Wear the fog, I'll forget the rules I've known
Look in cloud's mirror
When the sea calls me home

I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear

No recognized pattern",5
"I go out to find
The one with whom I've seen
All hour's moons
Once the curtains lifted
And he said ""I will swim to you""

Language is such a play 
He called his exit, but his eyes are irresolute
What pasts still sit today?
I feel I'm walking around in blue

He can hear me sing
He can hear me sing
Though he is far
I'll never lose sight of him

He turned to me then looked away
A silhouette
A silhouette
Still returns to me

I'll hand him his coat
It's exactly where he left it long ago
We'll fall all over floorboards
I lose my breath just envisioning the scene
Mysteries that wake up late, the table's set
And the painting of his face
No time to hesitate
I cede all my love and play your abandoned fool

Though he is far
I'll never lose 

He turned to me 
He turned to me and looked away

A silhouette
A silhouette returns to me
A silhouette

A silhouette
A silhouette returns to me
A silhouette

A silhouette returns to me",5
"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",5

Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people

Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?",5
"It's electric how my lipstick
Makes its own way right into your kiss, and
It's pathetic how we both get
Kinda fucked up, hanging on each other
We're ahead now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close
But I think that it's my body wanting it the most, like
Uh-huh! I don't know what it is I feel
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill, like

Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!) Uh-huh! (Uh-huh!)
But I know it's my emotions going in for the kill

It's electric how symmetric
We both get when you lay beside me
It's phonetic how our mouths grip
Almost too tight to the words we're sayin'
We're in deep now, should we slow down?
Should we slow down now?

'Cause I'm getting some kind of shake without you

Uh-huh! I think you're movin' in too close

"For the love of a woman a man unlocks his heart
And reveals all the secrets it holds
And the love of a woman will find his better part
When he gives her the key to his soul


He will listen to her dreams
He will ask her what she needs
He will help her build the life she wants to live
He will hold her when she cries
With a love that never dies
All these things he will give
For the love of a woman

For the love of a woman a man will sacrifice
While he waits for a moment of grace
With the love of a woman a man will pay the price
For the trust that he sees in her face
He will open any door
Leave the life he knew before
To convince her that he's all she'll ever need
And when he's afraid to start
He will step into the dark
'Cause he knows she'll give his eyes the power to see
With the love of a woman

And her promises to help her dreams come true
No there's nothing in this world that he won't do

Though he's not a work of art
He will try with all his heart
To become the man she knows that he can be
With the love of a woman
The love of a woman
He will give his life
For the love of a woman",7

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",6

Never in my wordland

In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",6

All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear

Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",7

I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere",8

"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

"Once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of Oz
And a wickeder, wickeder, wickeder witch there never, never was
She filled the folks in Munchkin land with terror and with dread
'Till one fine day from Kansas way a cyclone caught a house 
That brought the wicked, wicked witch her doom 
As she was flying on her broom
For the house fell on her head and the coroner pronounced her dead
And thru the town the joyous news was spread
 
Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
She's gone where the goblins go below, below, below, yo ho
Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out
Ding-dong! the merry-o sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead
 
Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch

Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out
Ding-dong! the merry-o sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead

"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

Why don't we let her know
She's got this kind of hope
Why don't we let her know

Laying naked on the pine floor
Lonely we dance around the dying

Lying naked on the pine floor 
Lonely we dance around the dying
Maybe she got what she came for

When I'm all alone. 
I can feel your heartbeat like it's my own.

I can hear your music from a million miles away,
The angels got right when they made you they way they made you.
Sometimes I wonder if you're made from bones and skin 
Or are you something for me to begin again, again. 

This love, this love 
This love, this love.

I will build you a mountain,
So you can see
All the away across the universe
To me.

I will build you shelter for when the days are cold .
I will be your shelter for when were old and kind

This love, this love, 
This love, this love

"He's a dog
But he's dressed up like a sheep
Got bones all through the backyard
But he likes to drink tea

We play scrabble on the weekend
And he talks about the weather most of the time
I thought my sacred body with him
It would be fine

And I walked into the doorway
He slid across the room
My heart, it started racing
I just didn't know what to do

And he laid me on the floor
And my screams they go unheard
The lady living next door
Well, she's 6 feet under the dirt

Daddy, why don't you protect me?
Someone's gonna hurt me, there's nothing I can do
Daddy, why don't you protect me?
Someone's gonna hurt me, there's nothing I can do

But he's dressed up like a sheep
He's got bones all through the backyard
But he likes to fool me

And I travel through the doorway
I thought I'd be fine
But it's not the way it's gonna go
This time

While it hears you, trapped in another dimension

I've got a mind full of blanks, I need to go somewhere new fast
And don't be shy, oh no, at least deliberately
'Cause no one really cares or wonders why anymore
Oh, I got music, coming out of my hands and feet and kisses

That is how it once was done
All the dreamers on the run

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting

Complicated mammals on the wings of robots

Burning inside you, so deep.

I'd give you anything
But I'd give you problems

It's alright with me.

I hear it in your voice
I see it in your lips
There's always a catch
I guess that's alright with me

Screaming in my ear.

Oh, time is over

But who knows?

Please don't deceive me, I'm just so easily fooled

Don't want to bring all that up, but they keep leaving it out
What to do?
We'll just let it be until they all need...

Bulletproof glass.
Bulletproof glass.
Bulletproof... you're in trouble now.
But who knows?
But who knows?

If you want to know somebody, might take a quick look at their best friends
Diamonds are hers, a dog is his
You can lie to yourself, but don't lie to me
It's what they want
Dominance and loyalty, romance and security
Stay behind...

I am lost, those were the days
The soft murmur of voices in the other room
Comforting you as you fall asleep
Staring at the mother-daughter clones go by
We're in a race against time
And time might be winning

And it's not going to take all day though
Watching the urban decay
All around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way, oh, somewhere

I might have used tricks to make you like me more
When I found you I was running wild
Let's get outta here
What's the trouble there

I wanna know
What were they thinking
'Cause I think
I think it too

Sliding across the Indian wilderness
Like the wind riding down sore throats
Six a.m now you're in Hollywood
And you're dancing, we made it
We are turning with the earth so fast
That it feels a lot slower

And it's not going to take all day though
Watching the urban decay
All around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way, oh, somewhere
Feels like I'm going left and right in the dark

How long will it take to fix what can't break

Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Wake up
Wake up 

Your Achilles heel is you like to feel your fingers on the wheel
Some live in the bottle, some live in the zoo
With the director and the actor and the crew and the viewers
Boys get their toys and girls got their dolls and
Nothing much gets easier in the final stages

Are you spending today as the same
As your life in corruption and temper in the way

Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Wake up

The Lenape tribes would soon get forced from their home.
Soon we'll all get pushed out as soon as I get sober.
I remember why I drank it all away.

Nauseous regrets are calling me on the phone
My shoes, they seem to be my only home.
The only thing to last will be my bones.
Oh, tonight you'll hear the animals next door to you moan.

Faces are changing on Ludlow St.
Yuppies invading on Ludlow St.
Night life is raging on Ludlow St.
History's fading.

"Somewhere along the way, my hopefulness turned to sadness
Somewhere along the way, my sadness turned to bitterness
Somewhere along the way, my bitterness turned to anger
Somewhere along the way, my anger turned to vengeance

And the ones who deserved it, they'll never understand it.
Yes, I know I'm going to Hell in a leather jacket
Least I'll be in another world while you're pissing on my casket

How could you be, oh
So perfect for me?
Why can't you ignore, oh
The things I did before?

Somewhere along the way, exacting vengeance gave excitement
Somewhere along the way, that excitement turned to pleasure
Somewhere along the way, that pleasure turned to madness
But sooner or later that kind of madness turns into pain

And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it
Those who helped me along the way, I smacked 'em as I thanked 'em
Yes, I know I'm going to Hell in a leather jacket
'Least I'll be in another world while you're pissing on my casket

And all that I can do is sing a song of faded glory
And all you got to do is sit there, look great, and make 'em horny
Together we'll sing songs and tell exaggerated stories
About the way we feel today and tonight and in the morning

How could you be, oh
So perfect for me?
Why can't you ignore, oh
The things I did before?

Take all your fears, pretend they're all true
Take all your plans, pretend they fell through
But that's what it's like

That's what it's like for most people in this world
The rich or the poor oh,
Muslims or Jews oh,
When roles are reversed oh,
Opinions are too
No, oh oh

That's all I'm gonna say now
Before they come knocking on my door now",6
"We might be in for a late night
Stuck in a lava flow of brake lights
I can hear a rattling bass drum driving back to where it came from
Sit back

I shop therefore I am the cause, protect me from what I was

Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Timing is everything, timing is everything, timing is everything, timing is everything
Timing is everything, timing is everything...

I'm at your feet, where critters meet
Who should be asleep and not crossing roads or highways
In the afterlife of super cities, rapidly devouring its outskirts
It's neon octopus arms redecorating late at night

Robot camp for kids who hate sports
Mothers crying at the airport
Finding the dreams you left behind to do, waving goodbye your young heart cries for you
Sit back

You're finding it hard to get very far
But we were born waiting in line
Grabbing the future by the eyes

Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, timing is everything, timing is everything
Getting the hang of it, timing is everything, getting the hang of it, timing is everything
Timing the hang of it, getting is everything,
Getting the timing of everything hanging is
Hanging the getting of timing the everything...

Like batteries we die, like rivers we dry
We fuel and recharge, that's humans and cars
My fun, my sun, be my homework done
Where did you go, you were my ride home

Is that what we want, is everything shot, is that what you ask for, 'cause that's what we got?

Nothing stands still
Nothing stands still",5
"I wish that clouds could hold me up like I thought as a child growing up
I wish I could sound as soothing as the rainfall
But I am only a drop from the storm.

I feel like a tourist out in the country
Once this whole world was all countryside
Feel like a tourist in the big city
Soon I will simply evaporate

They took the strings up north, the drums down south
After they crossed Afghanistan a long time ago
You're shuffling your feet into the next dimension
Soon skyscrapers will be everywhere

I feel like a tourist lost in the suburbs
Soon the whole world will be urban sprawl
Feel like a land lover out on the ocean
Feel like a teardrop streaming off your chin

Some will bet against you, try even to prevent you
But not many can stop you man, if you got a perfect plan
Can they possibly try, I demand to know why they would doubt you?
In this hand, a thousand generations

Feel like a tourist out in the desert
So hot it feels like the Devil's breath
Feel like a tourist out in the swampland
This world is just patches of water and land
Everywhere I go I'm a tourist,
But if you stay with me, I'll always be at home",6
"Give me one good reason why I shouldn't win
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)
If a falling leaf can't help my suffering
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said)

And I sat around my feet, 
to teach me how to float 
""Get out"" she cried, 
in the minute she died
He folded up her coat
And the family cried, 
go spinning 'cross the sky

If I sit and pray, my Christmas tree will die 
(Bill Drummond said, Bill Drummond said) 

And if his life gets out of hand 
And if his face turns blue 
These things are sent to try us 
And what more can we do? 
And then he walked around my garden 
And sniffed around my coat 
And then I looked around to see him 
His hands around her throat

When the smell of terror brings a thousand eyes
The red men come again
They kill my children and they kill my wife

Family dead, just freaking out bleeding
Stoned in the gutter

When the call up sounds to the real in deed
But do you really wanna know
How we rode into freedom on whimsy and greed?
And they said your time is over
I don't see any gallant calls
I don't see an inch of reflex
'cept to leave me bleeding
Bleeding, bleeding, bleeding

Reynard left and went to Warwickshire, to a mound near a railway line,
With canals and a freezing swamp. He climbs high up above the countryside
And breathes freely. To the south he could see Polesworth, and to the
North he could just make out the ruins of the priory where Joss and I
Played cricket as children. We were only three miles away, probably drinking
Tea and talking,

(Have you heard about the orphan, sitting by the coffin)

At the same time as he was taking the stanley knife out of
The bag. He pushed the point into his stomach,

(His Father's not a sinner no more)

until the light shone right
Through. And then he reached down, and he took the bag.
It's a plastic bag
With plastic handles
And plastic sides
And
And
And
And

Was any other way to you
I'd walk sound and miles
Any other way got close to you

But you I could never share
Oh I wouldn't have it any other way
And everything I have to say
Has probably been said many better ways

Sometimes I have you in my head
And loving with you I am happy
I think of things to say to you
Of evenings respenting another place

And everything feels so good here
Hand in hand in this other place
The things I do make you stare
Oh I wouldn't have it any other way

I sit alone and take care of my head
Or the feelings that I have in front of me
Changes that we could've made
All the things we could've done together

I have to work my way through the hustling mob
Sounds of the city pounding in my brain

To be someone you want to be

She smiles and the world goes whistlin' away

You swallow down with your last breath

And find me alone
And trapped amidst superlatives and greed
Shine underneath

I was thrown out of the crib into the snow
I was born to entertain, so here I go

Not easy but your hands around my neck
Could be construed as your being rude

Find the dinner gong, put down my fork
Start my song
Cause I could be anything you want me to be

Top or bottom face the monster let him know
I was born to entertain so here go
Top or bottom face the monster let him know
I was born to entertain so here go once more

Across the sea
So the story was recalled to me

Down in front of the Wailing Wall
And she cries all day so sad and alone
'Til someone comes along and leads her home
Nobody listens and nobody seems to care
But everyday you'll find them there and
Kneeling down
For sadness sake
Crying just as though their hearts would break
And from dawn 'til dark you hear them call
Down in front of the Wailing Wall
And they cry all day so sad and alone
'Til someone comes along and leads them home
You know I don't listen and you know that I don't care

When you're thinking you're that smart
Life's frozen with a broken heart

It's just better that way:
Go on thinking you're that cool
No one can send us back to school
There's just one more stupid thing to do 
You're not better than this 

I gently watch you fall
It feels like 
Destroying something beautiful
I gently watch you fall
It feels like
Destroying something beautiful

You''re not better than this:
And your life is not a big deal
With insomnia nothing is real
When you're down it doesn't matter how you feel
You're not better than this!

Like some precious only son
Face down, bow to the champion

You walk down alameda looking at the cracks in the sidewalk
Thinking about your friends
How you maintain all them in a constant state of suspense

For your own protection over their affection
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own because you can't finish what you start

Walk down alameda brushing off the nightmares you wish
Could plague me when I'm awake
And now you see your first mistake was thinking that you could relate

For one or two minutes she liked you
But the fix is in
You're all pretension
I never pay attention

Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own because you can't finish what you start

For your lovey-dovey honey I'm your once in a lifetime
Always be your prime time
Looking backwards see the blue sea

Gonna make it up to you
Got to make it up

Till we cry goodbye
And you know I'm gonna try a little harder everyday
Cause in this life you gotta work hard

"Mother Mary, your hold on me
Denies my feelings
From those who can see
Your sacred wisdom
Can caress my soul
Confused and forsaken
By what I've been told
It always sounded so right to me
To offer my prayers
With the hope to be free 
Mother Mary, is this wrong for me
To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me

I've heard your words
In so many ways
Do I trust myself
Beyond your praise
My heart has been touched
By something said
I want to go with her
I want to be led
I knelt at your side
Did you feel me
I gave you my all
To be nearer to thee

Mother Mary, is this wrong for me
To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me

You know I'll always be there [Repeat: x3]

Can't you show me a way to believe
Have I been enlightened, misled or deceived
It always sounded so right to me
To offer my prayers
With the hope to be free

Mother Mary, is this wrong for me
To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me",5

Where I'm off to no one knows

The one that really cares
Walking down this dusty road
Gives me strength to share

Won't you be my love again

You know you're gonna be in line
Won't you be my love again
For the second time
You know you're gonna be in line

Will you be my witness
To this love affair
Will you be the one for me
The answers to my prayers

"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...

And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help

"No money, no pride
Stick your finger in your eye

Save it for another guy
Kick yourself in the head
Pretty soon you will be dead
Get yourself another job

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why don't you get a life?
Nothing is a guaranteed
Don't hide your face; don't beg and plead
Being sorry for yourself
Put another record on
You're the answer; you're the cause
You're just another perfect flaw
I'm just as scared as you, you know?
But trying all the same

'Cause harmony's in sight

In the end, we're all afflicted
In the end, we're all addicted
In the end, we're junkies too

Swallow pride; it swallows you
Take that stride; I'll guide you through
Who's gonna help us in the end?
Not your brother, not your friend

Why don't you get a life?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fear is just a crying shame
Work it out or go insane
Think about the world instead

'Cause everything's alright
You don't have to worry
We've made it through the fight
You don't have to worry
'Cause harmony's in sight
You don't have to worry

Where all of God's creatures would love the human race
Hey, oh, oh, oh, why don't you get a life?
Oh, oh, oh
Being wealthy isn't bad
Despising it is what's so sad
Make a move
You've got a choice
Do something useful
With your voice
You don't have to worry

You don't have to worry
We've made it through the fight
You don't have to hurry

"Heaven help the soul that's severed
From the place where it belongs
Caught up in the mindless struggle
Of the weak against the strong 
Headlights along the border
Keep the peace; their law and order

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
It's their kind of strength
It's their only defense
An imaginary line

Just a kid and his younger brother
Headed for the wire
Had no rights in the telescopic sights
Of the vigilante's rifle fire

And now he's buried on the border
Where the rivers are blood not water

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of truth
It can only be proved
With imaginary lines

In times like these concerning
Who decides which bridge is burning
Don't fall for map reading
Just make sure that you're still breathing

After the lines were drawn, the children would
Dream of the pearls and how beautiful they were
Year after year they would dive to the bottom of
The lagoon hoping that the oysters would come back
They risked everything - their homes, families
And meager possessions - to search for the pearls
To make sure they were heavy enough to reach the
Bottom, the children tied stones to their backs
Many of them died; streams of blood and broken
Bodies rose to the surface of the lagoon, and
The lagoon cried

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of strength
Their only defense
An imaginary line

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of truth
It can only be proved
With imaginary lines",6
"When they sell the final weapon, we can all watch it blow
Keep the people working, working
Keep the people working, working
Keep the people working, working
Gotta keep the people working

In the bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working

From the mines of anatolia to the isle of mandalay
Along the coast of sullen africa, they're queuing up to pay
No cause, I don't discriminate, I sell to those who buy
There never was an innocent who didn't want to die
And with demand upon the increase what could keep the cost down
If I keep the people fighting, I can really go to town
No surprise, the cash you borrow, we can close the deal tomorrow
Just swiss francs or dollars won't cause me any borrow, boy

In a bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
In a bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working

Everybody itching for someone to serve the task
I'll arm the politician for the coup, the crew, the cast,
I have a score of different faces, I can look like a lord
Seen in high places, flying on the concorde

Well you can marvel at precision, you can dial a telephone
Call up color vision from the safety of your home
You can mount the great offensive from a button by the chair
If you arm the right system, you can ionize the air

In a bed of iron, they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
In a bed or iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
Like the wind across the frontier or the breaking light of day
I push across the mountains, all around the bay of biscay

Freeze in north america, boil in pakistan
All along the amazon, from the fire to the frying pan

Whether air, sea or battle ground, desert sand or snow
When they sell the final weapon we can all watch it blow

Don't you feel disgraced?

You're afraid to admit to being guilty
You're afraid to stare at your face
And you pretend that life is always rosy
Wake up and join the human race

When you can't even love yourself?
You think your word is Gospel now
You're just repeating past opinions

Maybe I was wrong
To believe it was you

Silence in this heartless time

Won't you tell me?

"Because of things remembered
Nothing changes; we simply follow
Rhythms that are distant echoes
Ancestors turning in their sleep
Silhouetted on the future
Playful figures that cut across the winking eye
Of God's projector
A partial eclipse of the original light
That eminates in all directions
So the darkness isn't pierced, but rather
Forced to retreat
Pushed out by its own internal explosion
The screen of God's movie is time expanding
And every atom is a solid globular mirror
In which His grotesque anamorphic grin
Splits the darkness!

[Chorus]
Everywhere our world's expanding
Journeys through the soul
Past all thought and understanding
Science or control

Looking to the future
Is looking at the past
In whichever direction you happen to face
You were forward, and I was slipping back
In the time it takes for the light of the stars to stir
The retina, rods and cones
History's in the beholder's eye
Fait accompli
Dans un outre androit
The further away we are, the farther back we see
Unless
We could gaze instantly across the sound
Where, moored like ships, planets anchored
Swing and sway
Golden barges laden down with mists and frozen crystals
Dancing away!

It's raining outside
Drenched in life's misery tonight
This lonely night

She won't be home tonight
Because our luck has changed
And nothing stays the same

When the sky falls down
Does it make a sound
On the other side of town?
So we live with less
Love and happiness
On the other side of town

I cry to sleep
Wondering who
Cradles you softly and true
Day for day
With the stars falling at our feet
All the time
We were living down on easy street

"Hate city rivals, first pulse and then freakola
Dreaming of redemption; no end
To the living edit, the sound of amputation
Or the centrifugal pull of an endless bend
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down 
There's a shimmering dog sayin' danger; what's at work here?
The in-growing twitch of faceless laughter
A cause without end to serve forever
The missionary madness of the sacrificial lamb

[Chorus]
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down

On the hero's tomb is written
Not what he was but what he should've been
And nothing you can do will change the circumstances
Just a mild infuriation with statistics of sin

[Chorus]

A circular lie in a calibrated order
Weathering time with salt and water
Tears that you cry are your endeavor
To break into the madness of imaginary lines, until...

You shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Till you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot, shoot that rebel king down
Till you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down",4
"Take me home for the ride
I won't be alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't be alone
We won't be alone tonight

I am standing in the shadows of the garden
Confessing to the pale moon above
If I tell you how I feel
You might harden
I'm scared of being lonely
And of dying without love

Take me home for the ride
I won't cry alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't cry alone
We won't cry alone tonight

I need everything I know you could provide me
But every time I love the flower dies
There's a darkness in the air
That seems to guide me
If you want to see the heartache
You can look into my eyes

Take me home for the ride
I won't die alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't die alone
We won't die alone tonight

Sometimes our emotions make it hard
For us to see that
At the heart of loving is respect and honesty
And sometimes I'm afraid that I give
Less than I should give
But this time I will hold you
For as long as I live
I won't die alone
You won't die alone
We won't die alone tonight",5
"Would you rather the feeling
Of no feeling at all?
A soundless sea that slips toward
The morning shore, where you stand transfixed
Void of emotion, no clue of a notion 
Transfixed like a stone
Enthralled by the feeling of no feeling at all

Pushed by my sail
I am moved by the whale
As he floats through life's seas
He seems always at ease
Show me how

Centurions guard the finely-tuned sensors
That tremble at the slightest onset of stirrings
Which switch the dampers to absorb the emotion
And trigger the filter that screens out
Time and passing
Transfixed like a stone
Enthralled by the feeling of no feeling at all

[Chorus]

What ya gonna do when it hits the fan?
Open your mind; make a brand new plan
Do you realize that it's in your head?
Want to understand but refuse instead
If you take a deep breath and inhale
Maybe you can understand the whale
We either comprehend or we seem to fail

And we're shaking the faith of the fools
Everyone's forsaking and breaking the rules.
Is there nothing sacred - we're naked,
In fear of what we do, they're watching you.",5
"I have walked through the fire as an ordinary man
And if I die, I die in peace, part of all that god has planned,
'Cause I believe in you and the best is yet to come,
You've been alone it's true, daddy's work is never done.
In my dreams, every night, I see the waves upon the sand
And you and I walk alone and there's a ring upon your hand.
Yes I believe in you and if my prayers are answered now,
I'm coming back , to you, I'm gonna find a way somehow.

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day.

Where you are is all there is, the only place I want to be
And love is war and war is cold, when you're so far across the sea.
Still I'm alive, still in love, I hope this letter finds you well,
Through the blood, through the flames, I can hear those wedding bells.

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day.

Darling you know the winds of peace are blowing,
(They say the answers written in the wind)
Still I can hear the fallen angels singing,
(Our love is stronger than the million miles that separate us)

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day....",6
"If you could say to me that you'd undoubtedly
Be faithful to me
Then I would say to you
That I'd undoubtedly be faithful to you.
After all this time
I am here to say
That I would sign upon the dotted line
Can't you read my mind?
That's all I've ever wanted from you
If we could share our lives
Without the compromise
I'd be faithful to you
If we could gravitate, learn to communicate
I'd be so faithful to you
After all this time
I am here to say
That I would sign upon the dotted line
Can't you read my mind?
That's all I've ever wanted from you
That's all I've ever wanted
There's never been a day when I could say
That I was falling out of love with you
And I would kiss the stars and hug the moon
For you to see that I'm in love with you
How could you be so blind?
After all this time
I am here to say
That I would sign upon the dotted line
Don't you feel it's time
We should settle down
Carress the love we have and live as one?
Can't you read my mind?

Be faithful to me

Come sing me a song.
Show me the way to go home.
I've been disconnected,
Loved and rejected,
Travelling inside of my soul.

And I've clenched my fist
And I've cried for love
And I've prayed for the other souls out of control
And the answers that came from above.

And it's good to be lonely sometimes,
It's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely sometimes,
At least I'm prepared for the fall
And it's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely.

Rain on the train tracks,
The beat of my heart,
The rhythm of life carries on,
In memories and dreams
Of the faces and places,
I know I'll always belong.

And I've clenched my fist
And I've cried for love
And I've prayed for the other souls out of control
And the answers that came from above.

It's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely sometimes,
At least I'm prepared for the fall
And it's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely.

All my fears
And all my doubts
And all my secrets
Have found me out.

And it's good to be lonely sometimes,
It's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely sometimes,
At least I'm prepared for the fall
And it's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely....",6

How many times can you trust your conviction,
How many times can you feel your own pain
And how many days of your life are prediction,
It seems that things will never change.

And how many times can we re-run the race that we've just won.

'Cause when you can't even take care of the past,
How do you expect the future to last?

Deforestation and the death of the trees,

How many times can we choose our own fate
And how many times can we clip the white dove's wing,

How many times can we sin without savior,
And how many times can we cloud our own truth
And how many times must we judge our own failure,

A touch beyond temptation,
A vision beyond vogue,
One of god's finest creations.

Well it's the kiss beyond the catcher,
There is nothing that could match her.

To touch her in a place,
Beyond the anguish of the chase,
Far from the endless race,
A love beyond embrace.

Well it's the kiss beyond the catcher,
There is nothing that could match her.
Nobody knows which way she goes!?
Nobody knows which way she goes!?

Well she's sitting there alone,
Like a queen upon a throne,
If she'd only catch my glance,
Then I might have half a chance.

Well it's the kiss beyond the catcher,
There is nothing that could match her.

There's nothing you can do to make me smile.

I'm sure there's something I could say,
To warm her heart and make her want to stay,
(If not) I'll be on my way!
(That's what they say) I'll be on my way!

It's the little boy inside,
That forces me to hide,
When the walls I'm breaking through,
Make me separate from you,
When all I wish to do
Is say that I love you.

Teach me to love once again.
Reach, if you can, for her angel - like hand
And pull her right into your heart.
Don't waste a day with your insecure ways,
She'll be gone - and you'll never see her again.

Say you love me...say it softly.

What can I say to hold you once again

There is a side of you that I can see
That doesn't belong in life without you next to me

What can I say to bring you home again

Beauty and brains are all that I've got

But nobody undoes me like the thought of you can do
They search my eyes but I don't know why
''cause all I ever do is cry
Everybody loves me but you

Girls want to be me so they can pick and choose
They figure out of ten men there's no way that they can lose
Men would walk the plank for me and set themselves on fire
What do they see in me that isn't sad and tired, tired

I could fill my life with people who want to be with me
Do like when they say there's other fish in the sea
There's a world out there and a million things to do
But what do I care if it doesn't include you, you

Everybody loves me, everyone but you
But nobody undoes me like the thought of you can do
They search my eyes but I don't know why

I see the end of the road in his eyes
He's got a long way to go

I hold him like a loaded gun
I know he might go off with anyone
But I know he's only tryin' to have some fun
He sees a couple of things in me
Like how I'm not very hard to please
It's really pretty easy
I see my long lost home in his eyes
He sees a nice hotel in mine

Makes me want to go fuck shit up

Satan Satan Satan, should I end it all

But you always end up coming down
When the sound comes around and goes in your ears
You can do anything you have no fears
When that sound comes around and goes in my ears
I can do anything I have no fears

Now, here comes the song I love so much
Makes me want to go fuck shit up
I got Nirvana in my head
I'm so glad I'm not dead

Here comes the song, I love it so much

Here comes the pain again.
Here comes the pain again.
Never give in.
Never give in.
Said I'd never love again.
I was a virgin then.
I was alone and I still am.
Here comes the pain
Here comes the pain
Feel like an alien.
I am my only friend.
I can't relate to you or them.
Death's just up around the bend.
Don't really suck it in.

"What's that over there moving on the wall
A second glance and it's not there at all
What's that sitting there on the page of my book
It hides behind the words when I try to take a closer look

I can't reach out and grab it but that's ok with me
What's that jumping up and down in the middle of the street
It lingers then it melts into the wavy liquid heat
What are all those dizzy circles in the corner of my eye
They laugh and float away as I look into the sky
Can't get my arms around it but that doesn't bother me
'cause all I have to do is dream

I see you every place I go
I see you in people I don't even know
I close my eyes and I see you
I open 'em wide and I see you
I see you

Who am I to close my mind from what it wants to see
And who are you to tell the truth and kill my fantasy
Why are all those people always saying things about me
I'm not a loser, I'm just lonely
Yeah I wanna lay down next to you
But I'm not one to complain
Yeah I wanna touch you too

Do me a favor and appease my aching eyes
Won't you please materialize
Play another of your tricks with my sight
Be here in the flesh tonight

What's that pretty little thing crawling up my wrist
Call me crazy, call me a masochist
But I'd rather have you in my mind than completely out of sight
So I'll just go on dreaming for the rest of my life

I see you every night and day
I see you in a million different ways
I close my eyes and I see you
I open 'em wide and I see you
Yeah, I see you

I wanna leave but I stay in my seat

'cause I'm ugly with a capital you
And I don't need a mirror to see that it's true

Ask me a question then I will mess up, ooh
I'll tell a lie and I'll never fess up
I'm pretty lost but I don't wanna be found
No no no no no
My tiny screams don't make a sound, no

'cause I'm ugly with a capital you
And I don't need a mirror to see that it's true
'cause I'm ugly with a capital you
And I need nobody to tell me the truth

"Reach inside carefully
Feel my psyche
Make it last
Put this moment under glass

Nobody really can do that
What a low fantasy
She don't know how to live

So alone
Somebody take me home
Alone too long it drags on
It's so wrong, so alone, so alone

Catatonic insomniac lying in the grass
What is she thinking of, overlooked by everybody?
A long embrace though you won't see it on her face

She's so alone
Somebody take me home
Alone too long it drags on
It's so wrong, so alone, so alone

Feels like an end, so much unsaid
Feels like an end, so much unsaid

So alone, somebody take me home
Alone too long it drags on
It's so wrong, so alone, so alone
So alone, so alone, so alone",5

I have a mind to just let my whole body go.

You look so human but hey one can never tell.
I got no secrets and I think that you should know

 I don't know what I like only know what I don't.
I don't like what I know only love what I don't.

Killing the irony that's ruining rock+roll.

How do you turn this on?

"You need more heat
This is a recurring theme
You die in flames in my dreams

""I need to get more sleep.""
This is what you always say
Lying in a junkie's way

Finding you turning blue
It's easy to discern the truth
I can see what not to do
One look at you the dying proof

Pick up your cigarette
Forget what I said
It's so hard to care what you do

You say, ""Look at me
Respectfully."" I can't

And I am not an actor
Am I supposed to lie down and die?",6

Am I only dreaming, or did I wake up dead?
Throw me in the garbage, shackled up in chains
But I still got my boots on
So I can walk away

You gotta try to stay alive
Leave me to the vultures
Throw me to the wolves
I'll live on tomorrow
And purity of soul

Dump me in the ocean
Tied to a piano
But you forgot to rip my heart out
Before you let me go

A heartbeat says you haven't died
You gotta try to stay alive

Lock me in the basement
Without anything to eat
You can hurt my body
But you can't hurt me",5

It's killing me, my darling, my darling, my darling
Tell me, what can I do? Help me help you

You never give me anything, anything, anything

Sweet on the outside, but bitter on the inside
I'm giving up now, but I swear to God I really tried
I was happy as a child",6

Something in my mind pulls me off the road
Got to get it down and out, out before it goes
Got to tell myself what I need to know

I see you from the thirteenth floor
This hotel has a thirteenth floor
I'm thinking out the window
""Come up and watch a video.""

Did you ever see the birth
Or first steps of a tune?
Beautiful to me
And alien to you

It has got a face only I could love
And I know my place outside the hub

He's someone that you kinda know
He's someone that you'd like to know
You kiss him on the cheek and go
You gotta go and be alone

All I think is all I go back to do
All I do is all I can't get to you

What am I? I'm a satellite

All I say is all I give back to you
All I think is all I go back to do

Was enough to alienate
After all, love is unbecoming

Scared of the future that's made of the past

But I'm not leaving and I'm not proud.

I'm sick of sneaking around 
I'm sick of sneaking around
I'm sick of sneaking around
I'm sick of sneaking around

Do me the honor of holding my hand on the plane
Take me on public transit
Express your feelings on the train
We travel together over time zones and weather
Never really touching the ground.

The only evidence I have
Dirty pictures in my bag.
Am I ever going to see where you live? 
Am I ever going to meet your kid? 

I'm sick of sneaking around 
I'm sick of sneaking around
I'm sick of sneaking around
I'm sick of sneaking around",3
"You were gonna let me go
No guts to tell me yourself
Go ahead and rub my nose in it
You can't fire me because I quit

You make me feel invisible
Well, surely you see me now
Stretched out on the floor of your house
Foaming at the mouth
With a needle in my arm
Next to a smoking gun
And an empty razor case
And a note that says :

Dear jack I hate you. love, Diane
Dear jack I hate you. love, Diane
Dear jack I hate you
I said yeah yeah yeah whoa.

The neighborhood is gonna watch me
As I create the great finale
A perfect swan dive out the window
Crash the car off the road

You're not gonna miss me
But you're gonna remember my body
Crumpled in a heap in the middle of your street.

Clean up your mess 
Clean up your mess
Clean up your mess
Clean up your mess

Finally you're carrying me
Over the threshold try to revive me
With a cold compress but it's too late
I guess your best just isn't good enough
When every warm embrace
It was a selfish act
And every smiling face
It was a trap
You shit
You stabbed me in the back

Dear jack I hate you. love, Diane
Dear jack I hate you. love, Diane
Dear jack I hate you
I said yeah yeah yeah whoa.

Clean up my mess
Clean up my mess
Clean up my mess
Clean up my mess",5
"Wake up naked
Stretch like a panther
Throw off the covers
Run to the mirror, my lover
Admire this face
It could help to save the world
This body must be seen to be believed
My back and torso like a man ray photo
This is a scene
We are improvising me.

You are the camera
You try to seduce me
You are the camera
You love me
I make love to you
You are the camera.

I practice different smiles
I rehearse different lines
Like the perfect comeback or an eloquent speech
Let's take a walk on the street on the stage
Don't say anything
Just follow me
Don't leave
Save me for posterity
What do I want to be seen buying? 
I write in my diary
Only what I want you to read.

You are the camera
A reason for living
You are the camera
I need you to need me
(I need you to justify my life)
You are the camera.

We sit down on the couch
On the left or on the right? 
What is my good side? 
Come in for a close-up
Fresh breath, perfect makeup
Are we gonna kiss on the mouth like I read about? 
I look right at you and see myself and I'm in love.

You are the camera
A reason for living
You are the camera
In the presence of greatness
You are the camera
I disappear what you're not here
You are the camera.",7

"Do you cry in the dark because it's easier to be alone than to talk? 
When the words aren't working and you don't know how to explain these thoughts
Every look and every (e)motion has a deeper meaning
Everybody hurts nobody only when they're dreaming

Do you cry in the dark? 
The light hurts when it hits your face
You don't want anyone to see you this way
You only want to be loved and taken away by someone
So you cry in the dark

And the picture of you holding hands by the fire is fading fast
And your heart is closing and you don't know how to get off this track
Every day you mime a prayer though your faith is shaken
Your godmother has got nobody because everybody's taken

Do you cry in the dark? 
The light hurts when it hits your face
You don't want anyone to see you this way
You only want to be loved and taken away by someone
So you cry in the dark

The waves are getting high
I'll find an island, call it mine
I'm swimming for my life

You don't want anyone to see you this way
You only want to be loved and taken away by someone
So you cry in the dark",6

Time would fly away

Feels like an hour
Wishing the day would end
Inside the prison in my head

Into a fool
Watching you walk away
Into another world

I was happy
When you loved me
Never lonely

Into another world

I only want you when you're on top
I'm afraid when I feel your love
I turned away
But I'm not better off
It should've been you",5
"Tonight we were going to go 
I know 
But Jamie's back in town 
I'm not gonna answer the phone 
I'm not home 
Because Jamie's back in town 
Jamie's back in town 
I can't run into him 
I don't want him to see me 
On a binge 
Na, na, na, na, na 
I hate it when Jamie's back in town 
I crawl into my cave 
With bloodshot eyes 
Little sugar pills to ease my mind 
I could turn into a butterfly 
Please let me know when he's gone 
I'll come out 
Until Jamie's back in town 
Jamie's back in town",4
"Put your ear next to my beating heart 
Still alive 
And if you pick me up in your arms 
I'll give you one more chance 
To try and knock me down again 
If you want to stand me up on frozen ground 
Go on take aim when I open my mouth 
I still love my enemy 
I still love my enemy 
You appointed me the stoic one 
Not allowed to cry these tears 
But silence belies the pain 
You pushed inside 
Impossible to love 
Is all that I know how to be 
But in my heart 
I keep repeating 
You didn't mean to hate me 
I still love my enemy
I still love my enemy ...",5
"Morning has come 
Much too soon 
He puts on his tie 
And thinks of you 
Singing in the shower 
Dreaming of nights he's been missing 
All of his life 
Singing in the shower 
No one can hear 
He's been no one for forty years 
He wanted to live like a rolling stone 
With a beautiful wife 
And city and country homes 
Singing in the shower 
He's off tonight 
He's been no one all of his life 
Singing in the shower 
No one can hear 
He's been waiting for forty years 
Tears in his eyes 
Washing away 
Singing in the shower 
No one can hear 
He's been waiting for forty years 
Singing in the shower 
Got no stage fright 
He's been practicing all of his life",6
"A whippoorwill sings and the morning brings 
Sunshine and freedom
A beautiful day
I just couldn't stay
Inside love's prison

But some rainy Sunday I'll wake from a dream
And wonder if you miss me
Some rainy Sunday I'll see things your way
And wish that you were with me

Telephone calls just hit the wall
And you can't see my side
Tied up with you in a manic mood
I just scream goodbye

Some rainy Sunday I'll wake from a dream
And wonder if you miss me
Some rainy Sunday, I'll see my mistake
And wish that you were with me

Ohhh, ohhh

Some rainy Sunday I'll wake from a dream
And wonder if you miss me
Some rainy Sunday, I'll see my mistake
And wish that you were with me",8
"Everybody gets down sometimes 
You get happy with a sugar buzz 
White chocolate is your favorite drug 
I go underneath the covers 
There are things I do not understand 
When I reach out will you slap my hand? 
I've been sleeping through my life 
Now I'm waking up 
And I want to stand in the sunshine 
I have never been ecstatic 
Had a flower but it never bloomed 
In the darkness of my wasted youth 
It was hiding in the shadows 
Learning to become invisible 
Uncover me 
Weeping willow 
I've been sleeping 
I've been sleeping through my life 
Now I'm waking up 
And I want to stand in the sunshine 
Waking up 
Forgotten memories of 
Laughter and war 
That we lived through 
And all the people that I never knew 
I've been sleeping through 
My life 
Now I'm waking up 
And I want to stand in the sunshine 
I'm waking up 
I want to stand in the sunshine",6
"You're sailing away, to another shore
My heartache today, I can't tell you anymore
And I thought I saw your shadow in the street today
But that was yesterday, oh that was yesterday

With a little courage, in time
You might forgive me
With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me

Believe me I know it's been hard for you
There's never an easy way to let it go
And I thought I saw your jacket in my room today
But that was yesterday, oh was that yesterday?

With a little courage, in time
You might forgive me
With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me

And I dreamt that you were telling me you dreamt of me
But now I'm waking up, oh I think I'm waking up
With a little courage, in time
You might forgive me

With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me
With a little courage, in time
You might forgive me

With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me",5
"She answers your questions but everybody lies
You're not the only one
And it's not her first time
She lets you stay and then she leaves
Like a midnight sun when does she sleep?

You're just a tourist in her world
You're just a tourist in her world
You're just a tourist in her world

You want to capture her, but you can't find the words
You can touch her skin, but you're blind to the light within 
And in the morning she pulls off her mask 
Makes her brown eyes green
It's a private show, but everybody stares
She turns into a ghost
Of someone that you think you know, but you don't

You're just a tourist in her world
You're just a tourist in her world
You're just a tourist in her world

You're just a tourist in her world
You're just a tourist in her world
You're just a tourist in her world",5
"I stand at the window looking out
Waiting for something, I don't know what
They don't see me so they're not scared
But they tread lightly everywhere

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand

Sunset?s pink and orange and lavender and gray
There's a bird on a branch at the top of the tree
We wanted the world to give us a chance
Now we're pushed out to the edges

If we stand still blinded by the lights
Is it murder or suicide?

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Over the sand

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand

"You better give this girl something
Because she's dying for a line
Tell her love is all we need
And we're not fighting for nothing

You see everything, it was how she knew
You would find her the perfect song between asleep and awake
In simple truths like blood in the streets
Sugar is sweet and the sky is blue

"I stayed until the Star Spangled Banner played
And I couldn't keep my eyes open
I stayed till the buds dried up and fell off on the table
And there was no hope of my saving them
Till the last levee broke and the floods came and washed away our home

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long

I stayed till the last of the bottles was empty
And whizzing by my head
I stayed till there was no more air in the room
And my tears no longer moved you
Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long, I stayed too long

Next time maybe I will know how to walk away
With pride and grace and faith in myself
Knowing how the world works and the way that things change

Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again
Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long, I stayed too long

"Is that you banging on my door at 3am?
And are you wasted again?

Normally I'd stay in bed
So if I get up and open the door
Don't let it go to your head

[Chorus]
It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you

Your jealousy and insecurity can be so over the top
I get so fatigued by these long emotional relationship talks
I'd really much prefer my own company most of the time
I never said I can't live without you baby
I just said you look good tonight

Normally I'd be making tracks
There's only one reason I came back

It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't necessarily mean that I even like you very much

[Chorus]

(Normally I'd kick you to the curb)",6
"It comes around at night
It's transparent in the light
You could crush it with a finger
And you'll do it just to watch it die

Flies are feeding on someone?s blood
Isn't it kind of just like love
Do they ever get enough?
Reason has no place in this vicious world

And I'm heading your way
Into your burning flame
It's the law of nature
It's the law of nature

I take what I need
Spit out the bones and seeds
Curl up with your skin to keep me warm
Reason has no chance in this selfish world

I don't listen to the preachers
I don't listen to the doctors
I don't listen to the leaders
Reason has no chance in this selfish world

And I'm heading your way
Into your burning flame
It's the law of nature
It's the law of nature

I live and breath
Always hungry for that heat, ooh, ooh, ooh

Reason has no chance in this selfish world
Reason has no chance in this vicious world

And I'm heading your way
Into your burning flame
It's the law of nature
It's the law of nature

"There's an open window where we are
It's a beautiful night full of stars
And isn't it a heavenly breeze
Whispering sweetly through the screen
All the little things are in place
I still like to dream
I still got the same face

[Chorus]
But oh my baby doesn't love me anymore
Oh my baby doesn't love me anymore
I just know, I just know

He used to look in my eyes and talk to me
But now we just have sex and watch tv
And when he touches my body
There's something off with the chemistry

I feel him going through the motions
The same ones that still breed hope in me

[Chorus]

Did he know me
Did he know
Did he ever
Where does love go when it goes
It's like a white bird in the snow

He used to want to make me breakfast
But more and more he's sleeping in
And though he doesn't want to hurt me
I know he'll soon be leaving

"Your memoirs are so full of tension
Well, don't I merit a mention?
Tell them how you're surrounded by idiots
How I was always much too stupid

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

You're holed up in your country estate surrounded by your sheep
They only love you because yours is the hand that feeds
But there's no stylistic variety
One of us is still hungry

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

Not coming back, I'm not coming back
Not coming back

I get no apology or a thank you or a please
When I suffer your neglect it's my responsibility
You lounge around your castle fingering your queen
With your chairs that no one sits on and your starched and ironed sheets
You have no faith in the future, you don't believe
That I still got the holy spirit in me

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

I'm not coming back
Not coming back, na, na, na, na

"We spoke two different languages
But a touch said everything we couldn't say
Translating every mystery of time and place

Remember November, remember November
Away in the dark you made me feel something
And gave me a reason to keep trying

Your hands were filled with electricity
Like the moon and stars lit from within
Illuminating something asleep in me

Remember November, remember November
Away in the dark you made me feel something
And gave me a reason to keep trying

A great escape from a lonely life
A great escape from a lonely life

Remember November, remember November
Away in the dark you made me feel something
And gave me a reason to keep trying
Away in the dark you made me feel something
And gave me a reason to keep trying, trying

"Tonight, I'm gonna take it easy
Don't wanna be down anymore
It's all still a mystery to me
I've forgotten what we were fighting for

Every light in my mind goes shining on
Every fire that died goes shining on
Every setting sun goes shining on
On and on and on, on and on and on

Do you need a resolution
To understand where the pain is coming from?
Were you accused of things you didn't do?
Or were you standing in the middle of a dream coming true?

Every light in my mind goes shining on
Every fire that died goes shining on
Every star at dawn goes shining on and on
On and on and on

Condemnations tears and lies released from memory
We will always be beautiful, beautiful
Condemnations tears and lies released from memory
We will always be beautiful on the night we kissed in the stairwell

Before we really knew each other yet
It may not be easy but we need to forget
All the mistakes, disasters and words
That should never have been spoken

Every light in my mind goes shining on
Every star at dawn goes shining on
Every setting sun goes shining on
On and on and on, on and on and on
On and on and on, shining on and on

"It's late at night and you need somebody to talk to
But who of all those people that you once knew
And if you called just what would you say
Would you break down straight away

[Chorus]
You're so alone
You're so alone
You want to die and nobody knows

You keep leaving messages that don't say anything
Like, ""Hi, how's it going?"" pretending you're okay
You disguise your fear so you don't scare them away
You don't want to go to sleep because the nightmares keep you awake

Your heart is beating strangely
Nausea and pains throughout your body

[Chorus: x4]

You've told everyone who ever meant anything to you
To please just go away
And now you've got nobody what are you supposed to do
It's getting late and the night is getting darker
And you're fading away

You're fading away

And you're talking to yourself
Is this really happening?
And I'm talking to myself
Is anybody listening?

"She writes songs at night
After everyone has turned out the lights
Though she's still young
She's had a hard life
And she's not giving up believing in fate
And it makes a person strong being alone for so long

The family home it's like living in a war zone
Holes are punched in walls
But no one seems to care at all

[Chorus]
She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world
She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world

They want to knock that smile off her face
So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
So with patience she waits

No one ever had her back
They only laugh when she cries
But in God's eyes

[Chorus]

They want to knock that smile off her face
So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
And with patience she waits

"I broke down on 14th street, I could have been blind
And you could have been anywhere in the world but I saw you in my mind
In flashing colors in the middle of the night
Don't they say that in the darkness everything is black and white

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, it's a lonely love

I found myself in Brooklyn, it was as real as a dream
Then I went back up to Boston with absolutely nothing but a feeling

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, it's a lonely love

How I wish I could escape the human things
Don't take me for a woman, I am only the song you sing

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Lonely love, lonely love, lonely love, this lonely love

Some never should've been boyfriends that ended in heartache
But I still try to see the brighter side

What goes up don't always come back down
What goes around don't always come around

The devil's been knocking at my door

I've been up and down this road before
I keep on coming back for more
And I still haven't figured a damn thing out about life

I've lived and learned and I've been burned but it's all a part of me
I've got bars around my heart, but I still believe
There's someone out there with a key

I still dream and I won't give up the fight
And who knows if I'll ever get it right

I've been down on my knees beggin' the lord
The devil's been knocking at my door

When the last loser left you alone

Are you listening
Have you even heard a single word I've said
Hello
Wake up and smell his cheap cologne

You cant give the fish all the blame

"Well, she started with a margarita
Then she went to straight tequila
And before the night was over, oh
Her little secret was between us
But she laughed, I cried
And she said, ""I'll be fine.""

Now she's barely walking and I'm thinking
Wonder how long she's been drinking, like this
She looks me in the eye and says, ""I swear I'm quitting.""
I almost believed it
Then she cried but she lies
Cause that's what she said last Saturday night

How am I suppose to help
Somebody when they tell you
That they don't need help
How am I suppose to reach a soul
That doesn't know they need to save themselves
My friend, I've done all I can do
You've got to
Help me, help you

Oh, I get home from work
I turn the TV on
The telephone's a ringing
Her little girl is crying
Says, ""I can't wake mama up from sleeping.""
Well, I burned that road
Opened up the door, she says,
""Leave me alone.""

It's been 4 years and now I stand
In the back of the room
She said, ""I started with a margarita
Then I went to straight tequila.""

Help me, help you",5
"I could catch just like a candle
Melt myself down to an end
And I have no way of ever coming back 'round here again
Or I could glow just like an amber
Rising out of an autumn fire
Drifting toward the heavens floating higher and higher
You better hide your matches boy

Cause I could spark like thin white paper
Wrapped tight 'round some cigarette
And leave nothing but the smell of smoke and the bitter taste of regret
Or I could get hot like them coals that turn the water into steam
And fall down around you like some misty morning
You better hide your matches boy
You better hide your matches boy

[Chorus:]
Oh, cause I'm bound to lose all I am right here in your arms
And it ain't gonna take much
And it ain't gonna take long
So you best turn your eyes if you're not ready tonight
To watch me burn like this
You better hide your matches

Cause I can't afford to let you go
I'm afraid to draw you near
Cause I could get so lost in you that I might disappear
And the words are on the tip of my tongue
But you won't hear a sound
Cause once that fire gets going there's no way to slow it down
You better hide your matches boy
You better hide your matches boy

You better hide your matches boy
Oh, yeah
You better hide your matches boy",6

Had the house to ourselves sittin' through a movie and makin' out
He said I had somethin' that he couldn't live without
And I'd get soft
I didn't think about it

Heard he made someone else a mom

Another daddy out runnin' around
Doin' everythin' but settlin' down yeahh

From the clothes I wore to the friends I picked to the boys I'd date

Cant believe I finally made it here

How many breaths you take.
The moments that take
You're breath away.
Baby take my breath away!

From a car that was waiting
For the light to turn

The love that had me in it
And the fire began to burn

But I'd stand in front
Of a train, train, train
Just to hold your hand
In the pouring rain, rain, rain
Yeah I'd jump off a cliff, cliff, cliff
Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips
I'd do anything I that gotta do
Just to be with
You, You, You

Well I'd seen you before
A couple times or more
I even called your friend

But when the stars were ready
You were always going steady
Up there on the fence

And when love came around
My guard was never down
I was quick on my feet

And I never would've thought
That I'd ever get caught
With my heart on my sleeve

Well I would run every stop sign
And I don't care
I would always be the first one there

Just to see that look in your eyes
When you know that you never have to, have to ask me twice

Just to hold your hand
Water your flowers
Hmm... Just to be with

Snowin' and blowin'
Up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop
Has begun

Giddy-up, jingle horse
Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle
In a jinglin' beat
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock

"You were hangin' your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

(I) don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy
Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say

(But I've)
(I've had that song in my head all day)
(Playin' in my head all day)

I said, 'How 'bout an autograph for 'ya
Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumpin' away, and I
I've had that song in my head all day

(I) don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy

"Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

"I'm Bert, p'raps you've heard of me
Bert, you've had word of me,
Jogging along, hearty and strong
Living on plates of fresh air
I dress up in fashion
And when I am feeling depressed
I shave from my cuff all the whiskers and fluff
Stick my hat on and toddle up West

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And saunter along like a toff
I walk down the Strand with my gloves on my hand
Then I walk down again with them off
I'm all airs and graces, correct easy paces
Without food so long I've forgot where my face is
I'm Bert, Bert, I haven't a shirt
But my people are well off you know.
Nearly everyone knows me from Smith to Lord Rosebr'y,
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow.

I stroll with Lord Hurlington,
Roll in The Burlington
Call for Champagne, walk out again
Come back and borrow the ink
I live most expensive
Like Tom Lipton I'm in the swim
He's got so much 'oof', he sleeps on the roof
And I live in the room over him.

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And saunter along Temple Bar
As round there I skip
I keep shouting 'Pip Pip!'
And the darn'd fools think I'm in my car
At Rothchilds I swank it
My body I plank it
On his front door step with 'The Mail' for a blanket
I'm Bert, Bert, and Rothchild was hurt
He said ' You can't sleep there' I said 'Oh'
He said 'I'm Rothchild sonny!' I said 'That's damn'd funny,
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow'

I smile condescendingly
While they're extending me
Cheer upon cheer when I appear
Captain with my polo team
So strict are my people
They're William the Conqueror's strain
If they ever knew I'd been talking to you
Why they'd never look at me again

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And reach Kempton park around three
I stand by the rail, when a horse is for sale
And you ought to see Wooton watch me
I lean on some awning while Lord Derby's yawning
Then he bids two thousand and I bid Good Morning
I'm Bert, Bert, I'd buy one, a cert
But where would I keep it you know
I can't let my man see me in bed with a gee-gee
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow!

My pose, Tho' ironical
Shows that my monocle
Holds up my face, keeps it in place,
Stops it from slipping away.
Cigars, I smoke thousands,
I usually deal in The Strand
But you've got to take care when you're getting them there
Or some idiot might stand on your hand.

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And Buckingham Palace I view.
I stand in the yard while they're changing the guard
And the queen shouts across ""Toodle oo""!
The Prince of Wales' brother along with some other
Slaps me on the back and says ""Come and see Mother""
But I'm Bert, Bert, and Royalty's hurt,
When they ask me to dine I say no.
I've just had a banana with Lady Diana
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow.",5
"Place park, scene dark, silvery moon is shining through the trees;
Cast two, me, you, sound of kisses floating on the breeze.
Act one, begun. Dialogue, ""Where would you like to spoon?""

I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune,
Honeymoon keep a shining in June,
Your silvery beams will bring love dreams, we'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon.

Act two, scene new, roses blooming all around the place;
Cast three, you, me, Preacher with a solemn looking face.
Choir sings, bell rings,Preacher: ""You are wed for evermore.""
Act two, all through, every night the same encore.

Of the silvery moon, (The silvery moon).
I want to spoon, (Want to spoon, Want to spoon)
To my honey I'll croon love's tune.

"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay
How are things in Glocca Morra this fine day?",4
"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps
Once I was young, but never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Once I was old, twenty years or so
Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun
But now I ain't for only one

I'm wise and I know what time it is now
I'm wise and I know what time it is now
I'm so wise and I know what time it is now",6
"If it were within our power,
Beyond the reach of slavish pride.
To no longer harbour grievances,
Behind the mask's opportunists facade.
We could welcome the responsibility
Like a long lost friend,
And re-establish the kingdom of laughter

In the dolls house once again.
For time has imprisoned us
In the order of our years,
In the discipline of our ways
And in the passing of momentary stillness
We can view our chaos in motion
And the subsequent collisions of fools
Well versed in the subtle art of slavery.",5

"Severance,
The birds of leaving call to us,
Yet here we stand
Endowed with the fear of flight.

Overland
The winds of change consume the land,
While we remain
In the shadow of summers now past.

When all the leaves
Have fallen and turned to dust,
Will we remain
Entrenched within our ways.

Indifference,
The plague that moves throughout this land
Omen signs
In the shapes of things to come.
Tomorrow's child is the only child.",4

Wipe the sleep from your eyes
And embrace the light.
You have slept now for a thousand years
Beneath starless nights.

And now it's time for you to renounce the old ways
And see a new dawn rise.

In former days
The masks were raised
When the god came down from off the mountain,
And a sacrifice was made
For they knew the day of WRATH
Was fast approaching.

Just like yesterday...
Before the war.

John Francis Dooley,
The scapegoat has run
All our sins are disowned.

And now it's time for you
To take off thy mask
And cross the Rubicon!

If you and I were one
Within the eyes of our designs,
It would still not change
The fact of our leaving.

For tonight we must leave
With the first gentle breeze.
For the Isles of Ken we are assailing!

Just like Ullyses, on an open sea
On an odyssey
Of self-discovery...",6

Adversity what have I done to you
To cause this reclusive silence

I remember when you held my hand
In the park we would play when the circus came to town.
Look! Over here.

The circus gathering
Moved silently along the rainswept boulevard.

As the moon rose again
For the very first time.

You know what came of him
To him, complexities seemed plain
He cursed the hour that gave birth to him
And saw that everything was vain

It's wisdom that had brought him to this state
How fortunate the man with none

You know what he became
They deified him in his life
Then had him murdered just the same
And as they raised the fatal knife
How loud he cried ""you too my son!""

And handed him the poisoned drink

But soon observed what followed on
It's honesty that brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with none

Here you can see respectable folk
Keeping to God's own laws
So far he hasn't taken heed
You who sit safe and warm indoors
Help to relieve out bitter need

In the spinning wheels of chance

And the sounds I believe rose our glow
And we're changing our ways

Yes, we are taking on different roads
Tell me more about the forest
That you once called home

For the wind cries of late
In the whispering leaves
And the sun will turn to waste
The heavens we build above

Father, teach your children
To treat our mother well
If we give her back her diamonds
She will offer up her pearl

We must sing her creation song

Invoke the spirits that feed us
This dreaming takes too long

And renounce temporal obligations.

To break the ties that bound us.

My fond arm round her flinging.

From out the wild woods ringing.
A bullet pierced my true love's side
In life's young spring so early.
And on my breast in blood she died
While soft winds shook the barley. 
But blood for blood without remorse
I've ta'en at oulart hollow.
I've lain my true love's clay like corpse
Where I full soon must follow.

For time has imprisoned us
in the order of our years,
in the discipline of our ways
and in the passing of momentary stillness
we can view our chaos in motion
and the subsequent collisions of fools
well versed in the subtle art of slavery.

"All your ships
Have left their moorings
Cast adrift
On the Sargasso Sea
Waiting for the wind
To set your sails free

When you reach
The end of your rainbow
Chasing shadows
And down on your luck
Look for the sign
Look for a sign

As you rise to the very top
Of your mountain
Just remember those
Poor lost souls
On their way down

You taught me patience
Was a virtue
I took my time
Let Nature take her cause
All was revealed
All in good time

Turn back your clocks
Open up your memories
Beneath the veil
Where time stands still
You showed me a sign
You showed me the sign",6
"Saw the demonstration
On remembrance day
Lest we forget the lesson
Enshrined in funeral clay
History is never written
By those who've lost
The defeated must bear witness to
Our collective memory loss

With every generation comes
Another memory lapse
See the demonstrations of
Failing to learn from our past
We live in the dream time
Nothing seems to last
Can you really plan a future
When you no longer have a past

Memories fall from the trees
Amnesia
Memories like autumn leaves

If we are subject to
Empirical minds
I wonder what lies beyond
Our memory's confines
If memory is the true
Sum of who we are
May your children know the truth
And shine like the brightest star

Memory, help me see
Amnesia
Memory, set me free

All my love and all my kisses
Sweet Mnemosyne
All my love and all my kisses
Sweet Mnemosyne
Sweet Mnemosyne",6
"We are ancients
As ancient as the sun
We came from the ocean
Once our ancestral home
So that one day
We could all return
To our birthright
The great celestial dome

We are the children of the sun
Our journey's just begun
Sunflowers in our hair
We are the children of the sun
There is room for everyone
Sunflowers in our hair

Throughout the ages
Of iron, bronze, and stone
We marveled at the night sky
And what may lie beyond
We burned offerings
To the elemental ones
Made sacrifices
For beauty, peace and love

We are the children of the sun
Our kingdom will come
Sunflowers in our hair
We are the children of the sun
Our carnival's begun
Our suns will fill the air

And you know it's time
To look for reasons why
Just reach up and touch the sky
To the heavens we'll ascend
We are the children of the sun
Our journey has begun

All the older children
Come out at night
Anemic, soulless
Great hunger in their eyes
Unaware of the beauty
That sleeps tonight

And all the queen's horses
And all the king's men
Will never put these children back
Together again

Faith, hope, our charities
Greed, sloth, our enemies

We are the children of the sun
We are the children of the sun",7
"Sometimes
I feel like I want to live
Far from the metropolis
Just walk through that door
Sometimes
I feel like I want to fly
Reach out to the painted sky
A prisoner to the wind 
A bird on the wing

Sometimes
I feel the ocean in my blood
See rain from the sky above
Her salt brined tears
And now
Those tears leave taste on my tongue
Like the warm rush you get from
Black opium
Black opium

Sometimes
I feel like I want to leave
Behind all these memories
And walk through that door
Outside
The black night calls my name
But all roads look the same
They lead nowhere
They lead nowhere",5
"[Bobby] Dear Erica, I would cherish you more than life itself.
[Yas] Wait, no you wouldn't.-
[Bobby] Don't Listen to him, he only cares about himself.-
[Yas] alright -
[Bobby] See I would be there through thick and thin,
in sickness and in health, from beginning to end.
You gotta decide, me or him, Erica, tell me I'm curious.
[Yas] Bobby, I didn't mean to cut you off but are you really being serious?
You sound delirious, I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Erica's my girl, she always has been, period.
She hates you, what makes you think she would date you?
You got a new girl, like every week, at least I'm faithful.
[Bobby] Erica, take my advice, like how long have you known me?
I know Yas, he's the kind that'd leave you stranded and lonely.
Why are you lying to me?
So don't come crying to me.
###
### just me,
and all I want is a chance,
but you can't make up your mind.
- Erica please.

I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
- Erica please.
[Joss Stone]
I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
[Bobby] Hold up, wait a minute,
I ain't afraid of commitment, but Yas is,
trust me, he'd be gone in an instant.
[Yas] Bobby's obsessive, he sleeps next to your pictures.
Now, let me go get Justin to cry you one more river.
- Cry me a river.
### big on pleasing but he acts like he mastered it.
I heard two minutes and he's sexually inadequate.
[Bobby] Okay, Yas, he's a loser, and I don't see the attraction,
all those pickup lines he uses, he read 'em in the last Maxim.
And ask him about how he likes to flirt with strangers.
He'd drop you in a second to watch the Indiana Pacers.
[Yas] Bobby, come on, you and Erica are dead wrong,
you'd have better luck hooking up with Stifler's Mom.
[Bobby] Listen, Erica's my soulmate, my fate, my world,
so get that through your head and go chase some other girl.
[Yas] Now Erica's my dream, my Billie Jean, my life.
Now is it him or is it me? You shouldn't have to think twice.
[Joss Stone]
I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
- Erica please.
I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
[Yas] Yo, you need to - pay me a listen, and -uh- follow my vision,
and -uh- stop playing mind games and make a decision.
[Bobby] Listen up, Erica, this whole charade feels senseless.
Never knew a girl could come between friendships.
[Joss Stone]
I never meant for this to grow so far,
I'm waiting to find out who you are.
[Bobby] Erica the beautiful
[Yas] slash dangerous,
[Bobby] slash hateful, 
[Yas] slash painful,
[Bobby] she's my dark angel
[Yas] oh what a tangled web she weaves, 
[Bobby] truly mine, 
[Yas] truly yours, 
- Erica please.
[Joss Stone]
I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.

You wanna be a star, here's a gimmick and a style,
To mimmick and free clothes to help design your image.
I feel like the only way I'll see fame and wealth,
Is to kill myself the same week my record hits the shelf.
All you really need is a record label budget,
Then watch the machine force feed it to the public.
Hate it or love it, watch it or unplug it.
Careers disappear quicker than next week's club hit.
You're just a puppet on a string I'm your master.
You're not cut out to sing, you might as well be an actor.
Or write a chapter how sex sells music,
Nobody likes your songs, they watch your videos muted.
Mixed and diluted, polluted trashed will crash.

What would you do for that big contract?
Change your face like Michael, be on American Idol?
Act homicidal and eat your own intestines.
I thought we were musicians not Fear Factor contestants.
Overnight stars want credit? Forget it.
Yeah, you went platinum, but who bought your record?
Extra philosophy, behind a music prodigy.
The next best thing since The Motley Crue Biography.
It's like Gods become a shark in deep water.
You swim up to the mainstream, then you bite the author.
You could be a star, too, if you're near edges.
Fuck the opinions of these haters and critics.
They can be so cynic, quick to call you a gimmick.
You can't tarnish my image, you can't write it, I live it.

"Why are such a stupid asshole?
Would you really like to know? 
Well, pay your fee, remove your clothes and Yvette will show you how
You went to school where you were taught to fear and to obey
Be cheerful, fit in, or someone might think you're weird
Life can be perfect, people can be trusted
Someday, I will fall in love, a nice quiet home of my very own
Free from all pain, happy and having fun all the time
It never happened, did it?",6
"Dog Bite""

Dog bite
On my leg
Not right
Supposed to beg 
Daily to the filling station
Underwater navigation

"I'm tired of kissin' ass
I can't sit still all day
You know I know your school's a lie
That's why you dragged me here 

'You're a hyperactive child
You're disruptive, you're too wild
We're going to calm you down
Now this won't hurt a bit' 

Drag me to the floor
Pullin' down my pants
Ram a needle up my butt
Put my brain into a trance 

'No more hyperactive child
Got too much of a mind
Wouldn't you rather be happy?
Now this won't hurt a bit' 

Cameras in the balls
No windows, just brick walls
Pledge allegiance to a flag
Now you will obey",5
"i finally found a job in a paper
Movin' barrels at a chemical plant
There's shiny-looking dust on my fingers
Goin' up my nose and into my lungs 

It's the Kepone poisoning-Minamata
Kepone poisoning-Minamata
At the grimy Kepone Factory
Turning people into bonzai trees 

Now I've got these splitting headaches
I can't quite get it up no more
I can't sleep and it's driving me crazy
I shake all day and I'm seeing double 

Kepone poisoning-Minamata
Kepone poisoning-Minamata 

Gonna go down your big metal building
Gonna slam right through your bright metal door
Gonna grab you by your sta-prest collar
And ram some kepone down your throat 

The lawyer says 'That's the breaks, kid
Gonna gnarl and rot the rest of your life
If you don't sue, we'll give you a Trans-Am:'
That I'll never drive 'cause I shake all the time

"You call yourself the moral majority
We call ourselves the people in the real world
Trying to rub us out, but we're going to survive
God must be dead if you're alive 

You say, 'god loves you. come and buy the good news'
Then you buy the president and swimming pools
If Jesus don't save 'til we're lining your pockets
God must be dead if you're alive 

Circus-tent con-men and southern belle bunnies
Milk your emotions then they steal your money
It's the new dark ages with the fascists toting bibles
Cheap nostalgia for the Salem witch trials 

Stodgy ayatollahs in their double-knit ties
Burn lots of books so they can feed you their lies
Masturbating with a flag and a bible
God must be dead if you're alive 

Blow it out your ass, Jerry Falwell
Blow it out your ass, Jesse Helms
Blow it out your ass, Ronald Reagan
What's wrong with a mind of my own? 

You don't want abortions, you want battered children
You want to ban the pill as if that solves the problem
Now you want to force us to pray in school
God must be dead if you're such a fool 

You're planning for a war with or without Iran
Building a police state with the Ku Klux Klan
Pissed at your neighbor? don't bother to nag
Pick up the phone and turn in a fag 

Blow it out your ass, Terry Dolan
Blow it out your ass, Phyllis Schlafly
Ram it up your cunt, Anita
'Cause god must be dead
If you're alive
God must be dead
If you're alive",5

You ain't no better than the bouncers
We ain't trying to be police
When you ape the cops it ain't anarchy

Ten guys jump one, what a man
You fight each other, the police state wins
Stab your backs when you trash our halls
Trash a bank if you've got real balls

You still think swastikas look cool
The real Nazis run your schools
They're coaches, businessmen and cops
In a real fourth Reich you'll be the first to go

You'll be the first to go
You'll be the first to go
You'll be the first to go

Bleed for me 

In the name of world peace
In the name of world profits
America pumps up our secret police
America wants fuel
To get it, it needs puppets
So what's ten million dead if it's keeping out the Russians?

We're well-trained by the CIA with Yankee tax money in Ft. Bragg
The Peace Corps builds US labor camps when they think they're building schools, ha!

When cowboy Ronnie comes to town
Forks out his tongue at human rights
Sit down, enjoy our ethnic meal
Dine on some charbroiled nuns
Try a medal on
Smile at the mirror as the cameras click
And make big business happy

Anytime
Anywhere
Maybe you'll just disappear 

C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
Bleed for me",5
"Buzzbomb Buzzbomb, macho-mobile
The road's my slave, that's how I feel 

I cruise alone, I cruise real far
I don't love you, I love my car 

(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh)

Cross Nevada at a hundred-and-ten
Highway 50 and there's nobody there
Sign says, ""next sign thirty miles"" 

I work all week, each penny saved buys more escape from home
I'd rather cruise around all day than save up for a move 

Plow through rest area San-O-Lets
Splat, goes the lonely salesman
Wanking in the men's room 

Buzzbomb Buzzbomb, tape up loud
Blue piss clinging to my windshield
Faster, faster in my car 

Buzzbomb is my pride and joy, king of the trailer court
Waiting for the perfect chick, who'll love me for my car 

I tell her why I'm cool
She coos back, just what I like
When I pretend she's near 

Zip through Ely where Pat Nixon was born
The cops 'round here sure looking bored
Flashing sirens, state patrol 

They're scratching up my gorgeous paint job, shooting out my tires
Ain't no way to go to heaven

Hell, we all die in the end

"No junk food, just earthly goods

Burning wealthy California homes
Better run run run run run run from the fire

And we laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh at your lives 

Windows covered with bars
Security guards
Is that a house or a fortress?
Against the rest of the world 

Windows covered with bars
Security guards
Is that a house or a prison, how you gonna get out? 

Electric bull and your tennis courts
Pink sports cars and your boats
Getting fried fried fried fried fried fried by the fire 

Windows covered with bars
Floodlights for the yard
It's a pleasure to watch you
Watch it all melt 

But hey!
What about the cocaine
Stockpiled in the basement?
Be a hero and save it
You know you're gonna need it 

Where's your brand new pretty wife?
She might still be inside
Either save her or your cocaine from the fire 

But the gates and doors are locked
'Cause the burglar alarms went off
Ever wonder why we laugh laugh at your lives? 

Windows covered with bars
Fences spiked with barbed wire
Never looked so helpless
Engulfed in flames 

Cameras watchin' the walls
Don't forget the dogs
Now you're trapped in your prison how you gonna get out?

If you demonstrate against somebody we like
I'll slip on my wig and see if I can start a riot
Transform you to an angry mob
And all your leaders go to jail for my job

Fill you full of LSD

The press, they never even cared
Why a youth leader walked into a speeding car
In ten years or so we'll leak the truth
But by then it's only so much paper 

You know, Watergate hurt
But nothing really ever changed
A teeny bit quiter but we still play our little games 

But we still play our little games
But we still play our little games
We still play our little, we still play our little, we still play our little
We still play a lot of games!

"Rioting, the unbeatable high
Adrenalin shoots your nerves to the sky
Everyone knows this town is gonna blow
And it's all
Gonna blow right now

Now you can smash all the windows that you want
All you really need are some friends and a rock
Throwing a brick never felt so damn good
Smash more glass
Scream with a laugh
And wallow with the crowds, watch them kicking peoples' ass 

But you get to the place
Where the real slave-drivers live
It's walled off by the riot squad aiming guns right at your head
So you turn right around
And play right into their hands
And set your own neighborhood
Burning to the ground instead

Ah, ha-ha

Riot, playing right into their hands
Tomorrow you're homeless, tonight it's a blast 

Get your kicks in quick
They're callin' the National Guard
Now could be your only chance to torch a police car 
Climb the roof, kick the siren in and jump and yelp for joy
Quickly, dive back in the crowd, slip away, now don't get caught 

Let's loot the spiffy hi-fi store, grab as much as you can hold
Pray your full arms don't fall off, here comes the owner with a gun 

Ah, ha-ha

Cops in helmets line the lines
Shotguns prod into your bellies
The trigger fingers want an excuse
Now!

The raging mob has lost its nerve
There's more of us but who goes first?
No one dares to cross the line
The cops know that they've won 

It's all over but not quite, the pigs have just begun to fight
They club your heads, kick your teeth
Police can riot all that they please

I join the right clubs just to build an impression
I block out thinking, it won't get me ahead

All I want is a slot

Stacked in rows up the wall to impress all my friends

I just want to get drunk
And major in business
And be taught how to fuck, whoo, win

Win, I always play to win
Want to fit in like a cog
In the faceless machine

Terminal, terminal, terminal preppie
Terminal, terminal, terminal, terminal
Terminal, terminal, terminal, terminal 

I want a wife with tits
Who just smiles all the time

Filled with Springsteen and wine 

Some day I'll have power
Some day I'll have boats

With Thanksgivings to host

"Another rainy morning mingling at the market
Bartering for food for another day
Rifle shots ring out behind the crumbling buildings
Executions have begun 

Sprawled in the square are today's broken bodies
Lots to pick clean if you're first and quick
Rift through their pockets, peel off their clothes
To wear or sell when you wash out the blood 

Run my little brother
Run to the chicken farm
Opportunity is calling
You might even find a watch 

We're going down
To the chicken farm 

Napalm rains no more
But the war goes on
Little brother died playing at the dump today
He found a new toy and held it up proud
Then it blew him to bits 

How many more children 
Will be killed or die at birth 
Deformed by Agent Orange 
In our food chain forever more 
We're going down 
To the chicken farm 
This time we'll buy our way out 
I've got a plan; you wait and see 
I smuggled you this map 
In the gash I sliced in my thigh 
I hope I'm there to join you, love 
We're blown to bits one by one in this camp 
We crawl shaking through the fields at gunpoint all day 
To defuse leftover landmines-by hand 
We shiver on the deck and stiffen for the worst
If the pirates come around we might as well be dead
We'll be thrown in the sea
Or butchered if we're women
All in the name of gold 
One foot in a land we can barely understand
Can't speak the tongue of Yankee hospitality
Our kids at school get beat up
To the tune of ""Boat people, go home"" 

Sliced with a machete
From the breast of our homeland
Our new world tries to spit us out
But it sure beats the chicken farm",5

We are the Goons of Hazzard 
Glorified on your TV 
We run down bikes and hitch hikers 
And we know we'll get off scot-free 

We're the vigilante heroes of your tough-guy flicks
Bashing punks & bums and fags
With our baseball bats
No deer to blow away in the woods today

So we go to Oroville and shoot a black kid down
Or waste demonstrators in Greensboro instead 
We are the Goons of Hazzard 
Glorified on your TV 

We leave you in a pool of blood 
'Cause we know we'll get off scot-free

Come here

Come here
Say something to me? 

We've got him cornered
We've got him cornered

Does anybody even care?
No!

City fathers and Chamber of Commerce want us deputized

"In lonely gas stations with mini-marts
You'll find rows of them for sale
Liquor-filled statues of Elvis Presley
Drink like a vampire 
His disciples flock to such a fitting shrine
Sprawled across from his graceless mansion
A shopping mall
Filled with prayer rugs and Elvis dolls 

And I wonder
Yeah I wonder
Will Elvis take the place of Jesus in a thousand years 

Religious wars
Barbaric laws
Bloodshed worldwide
Over what's left of his myth 

A growing boy needs his lunch 

When pesticides get banned we're safe up north
We just sell them to those other countries
Soon there's lots of exotic deformed babies
Somehow that's not our fault 

Just dip 'em in glaze paint 'em orange and green
For the Arizona roadside stands
To sell alongside plaster burros and birthbaths 

And I wonder
Yeah I wonder
Why so many insects around us feed off the dead 

Death squads
Starvation
Foreign aid?
Just leave it to the magic of the marketplace 

A growing boy needs his lunch 

Everyone should just love each other 
Dip your toe into the fire 
Drop your guns and lawsuits and love each other 
Life begins beyond the bunker 
And while you're busy hugging in the streets
Outgrowing your hatred for all to feel
Jiminy Cricket's found a game to play
Stick your neck out and trust-It'll be chopped away 
Jimmy through your locked front doors
Rifle through your sacred drawers
Line my pockets
Deface your dreams
Til the cows come home to me 

Nibbling like an earwig winding through your brain
Bound like Lawrence Harvey spread eagle to a bed
The migraine gets worse when we find out we lay eggs
And no one in all of Borneo can hear you scream 

Turn on
Tune in
Cop out 

Drop kick 
Turn in 
Tune out",6

You're the one who dragged me here
And now you drag me back 

To this Hellnation 

[Chorus]
Problem is, few care
About the people in despair
If you help no one
You're guilty in the Hellnation 

Hellnation's when the president
Asks for four more fucking years
Hellnation's when he gets it
By conning poor people and peers 

Hellnation-got no choice
What's the point of trying to vote?
When this country makes war
We all die in the same boat 

In this Hellnation 

[Chorus]

It's the only world we've got
Let's protect it while we can
It's all there is and there ain't no more 

Hellnation-asking please
For a nuclear freeze
So the unborn kids
Get their chance to live and breathe 

Hellnation asking aid
For the minimum wage
So the kids of tomorrow
Don't wind up slaves to their trade
In the Hellnation 

[Chorus]",5
"You really like gorillas?
We've got just the pet for you
It's the way you're forced to act
To survive our schools 

Make your whole life revolve around sports
Walk tough-don't act too smart
Be a mean machine
Then we'll let you get ahead 

Jock-O-Rama-Save my soul 
We're under the thumb of the Beef Patrol 
The future of America is in their hands 
Watch it roll over Niagara Falls 
Pep rally in the holy temple
And you're forced to go
Masturbate en masse
With the favored religious cult 
Cheerleaders yell-""Ra Ra Team""
From the locker room parades the prime beef
When archaeologists dig this up
They'll either laugh or cry 

Jock-O-Rama-On the brain 
Redneck-a-thon drivin' me insane 
The future of America is in their hands 
Watch it roll over Niagara Falls 
Unzip that old time religion
On the almighty football field
Beer bellies of all ages
Come to watch the gladiators bleed 
""Now boys, this game ain't played for fun
You're going out there to win
How d'ya win?
Get out there
And snap the other guy's knee!"" 

Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up!
Ra Ra Ra
Snap those spinal cords
Ha Ha Ha 

The star quarterback lies injured
Unconscious on the football field
Looks like his neck's been broken
Seems to happen somewhere every year 

His mom and dad clutch themselves and cry
Their favorite son will never walk again
Coach says, ""That boy gave a hundred percent
What spirit
What a man"" 

But who cares?
Games over-Let's go get wasted man
To the 7-11, to the liquor store
Let's party all night and party some more 

Another Trans-Am
Wrapped itself around a telephone pole
""I ain't drunk, officer
I just fell gettin' out of my car"" 

Don't worry about it, son
We were that way when we were young
You've got all the skills
To make a damn good businessman 

Jock-O-Rama-that's the law 
Come lick the butts of the Beef Patrol 
If the future of America is handed to them 
Watch it roll over Niagara Falls",5
"Fun Fun Fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb
Woof down the beer

Hi
I'm your video DJ
I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes
I wear a satin baseball jacket everywhere I go 

My job is to help destroy
What's left of your imagination
By feeding you endless doses
Of sugar-coated mindless garbage 

So don't create
Be sedate
Be a vegetable at home
And thwack on that dial
If we have our way even you will believe
This is the future of rock and roll 

How far will you go
How low will you stoop
To tranquilize our minds with your sugar-coated swill 

You've turned rock and roll rebellion
Into Pat Boone sedation
Making sure nothing's left to the imagination 

M.T.V. Get off the 
M.T.V. Get off the 
M.T.V. Get off the air
Get off the air 

See the latest rejects from the muppet show
Wag their tits and their dicks
As they lip-synch on screen 
There's something I don't like
About a band who always smiles
Another tax write-off
For some schmuck who doesn't care 

M.T.V. Get off the air 
And so it was
Our beloved corporate gods
Claimed they created rock video

Allowing it to sink as low in one year
As commercial TV has in 25 
""It's the new frontier,"" they say
It's wide open, anything can happen

But you've got a lot of nerve
To call yourself a pioneer
When you're too god-damn conservative
To take real chances. 

Tin-eared
Graph-paper brained accountants
Instead of music fans
Call all the shots at giant record companies now 

The lowest common denominator rules
Forget honesty
Forget creativity
The dumbest buy the mostest
That's the name of the game 

But sales are slumping
And no one will say why
Could it be they put out one too many lousy records?!? 

M.T.V.-Get off the air! 
NOW",5
"We're sorry
But you're no longer needed
Or wanted
Or even cared about here 
Machines can do a better job than you
This is what you get for asking questions 

The unions agree
'Sacrifices must be made'
Computers never go on strike
To save the working man you've got to put him out to pasture 

Looks like we'll have to let you go
Doesn't it feel fulfilling to know
That you-the human being-are now obsolete
And there's nothing in hell we'll let you do about it 

Soup is good food-(We don't need you any more) 
You made a good meal-(We don't need you any more) 
Now how do you feel-(We don't need you any more) 
To be shit out our ass 
And thrown in the cold like a piece of trash 
We're sorry
You'll just have to leave
Unemployment runs out after just six weeks 
How does it feel to be a budget cut?
You're snipped
You no longer exist 

Your number's been purged from our central computer
So we can rig the facts
And sweep you under the rug
See our chart? Unemployment's going down
If that ruins your life that's your problem 

Soup is Good Food, Etc. 
We're sorry
We hate to interrupt
But it's against the law to jump off this bridge 
You'll just have to kill yourself somewhere else
A tourist might see you
And we wouldn't want that 

I'm just doing my job, you know
So say uncle
And we'll take you to the mental health zoo
Force feed you mind-melting chemicals
Til even the outside world looks great 

In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore 

So they're dumped (with no minister present)
In a spiraling corkscrew dispose-all unit
Ground into sludge and flushed away
Aw geez 

Soup is good food 
You made a good meal, etc:. 
We know how much you'd like to die
We joke about it on our coffee breaks
But we're paid to force you to have a nice day
In the wonderful world we made just for you 
""Poor Rats"", we human rodents chuckle
At least we get a dignified cremation
At yet
At 6:00 tomorrow morning
It's time to get up and go to work",6
"Finally got to Washington in the middle of the night
I couldn't wait
I headed straight for the Capitol Mall
My heart began to pound
Yahoo! It really exists
The American International Pictures logo

I looked up at that Capitol Building
Couldn't help but wonder why
I felt like saying ""Hello, old friend""

Walked up the hill to touch it
Then I unzipped my pants
And pissed on it when nobody was looking

Like a great eternal Klansman
With his two flashing red eyes
Turn around he's always watching
The Washington monument pricks the sky
With flags like pubic hair ringed 'round the bottom

The symbols of our heritage
Lit up proudly in the night
Somehow fits to see the homeless people
Passed out on the lawn

So this is where it happens
The power games and bribes
All lobbying for a piece of ass

Of the stars and stripes of corruption
Makes me feel so ashamed
To be an American
When we're too stuck up to learn from our mistakes
Trying to start another Vietnam
Whilke fiddling while Rome burns at home
The Boss says, ""You're laid off. Blame the Japanese""
""America's back,"" alright
At the game it plays the worst
Strip mining the world like a slave plantation

No wonder others hate us
And the Hitlers we handpick
To bleed their people dry
For our evil empire

The drug we're fed
To make us like it
Is God and country with a band

People we know who should know better
Howl, ""America riles. Let's go to war!""
Business scams are what's worth dying for

Are the Soviets our worst enemy?
We're destroying ourselves instead
Who cares about our civil rights
As long as I get paid?

The blind Me-Generation
Doesn't care if life's a lie

So easily used, so proud to enforce

The stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down!
Tell me who's the real patriots
The Archie Bunker slobs waving flags?
Or the people with the guts to work
For some real change
Rednecks and bombs don't make us strong
We loot the world, yet we can't even feed ourselves
Our real test of strength is caring
Not the toys of war we sell the world
Just carry on, thankful to be farmed like worms
Old glory for a blanket
As you suck on your thumbs

Real freedom scares you
'Cause it means responsibility

So you chicken out and threaten me

Saying, ""Love it or leave it""
I'll get beat up if I criticize it
You say you'll fight to the death
To save your worthless flag

If you want a banana republic that bad
Why don't you go move to one
But what can just one of us do?
Against all that money and power
Trying to crush us into roaches?

We don't destroy society in a day
Until we change ourselves first
From the inside out

We can start by not lying so much
And treating other people like dirt
It's easy not to base our lives
On how much we can scam

And you know
It feels good to lift that monkey off our backs

I'm thankful I live in a place
Where I can say the things I do
Without being taken out and shot
So I'm on guard against the goons
Trying to take my rights away
We've got to rise above the need for cops and laws

Let kids learn communication
Instead of schools pushing competition
How about more art and theater instead of sports?

People will always do drugs
Let's legalize them
Crime drops when the mob can't price them
Budget's in the red?
Let's tax religion

No one will do it for us
We'll just have to fix ourselves
Honesty ain't all that hard
Just put Rambo back inside your pants
Causing trouble for the system is much more fun

Thank you for the toilet paper
But your flag is meaningless to me
Look around, we're all people
Who needs countries anyway?

Our land, I love it too
I think I love it more than you
I care enough to fight

The stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down!
If we don't try
If we just lie
If we can't find
A way to do it better than this
Who will?",5
"Step right up folks 

Anarchy for sale!
T-shirts only ten dollars
Badges only 3.50
I nicked the design, never asked the band
I never listen to them either

Another fast-food fad to throw away 

Get your anarchy for sale

"Poison is bubbling
Beneath your dreamhome
Buried there years before 

Kid runs in crying
From playing in the garden
""Mommy, I burned my hands!"" 

""What's making our eyes so itchy?""
""Don't rub 'em-they'll swell up."" 

Oh Oh Oh Oh 
It's the big waste dump
Oh, yeah 

We built your ticky-tacky houses
On landfill soil
To cover up a gift
We left you years before 

Of toxic chemicals
And leaking gas
Just dig a little while,
You'll find our acid baths 

Cesspools
In Eden
Oozing away: 

Groundwater's poisoned
Air stings like hell
The lines for doctors grow long 

Over martinis
The company laughs
""We don't owe you one damn thing."" 

But what about all these fainting spells?
How'd you like a lick
From my open sores 

And Oh:.Oh Oh Oh - 
Why are our babies stillborn? 

A storage tank's leaking
It's about to explode
Why evacuate
When you can watch the fun 

Nothing happens here
Get out the lawn chairs
We'll drink pink lemonade
And watch Martinez burn 

Cesspools
In Eden
Oozing away
Cesspools in Eden
Leak by the day 

The land we sold you
Is right atop our acid pits
We fill them by the truckload
In the dead of night 

There's thousands more toxic
Tips of the iceberg
We pay a little bribe
Or we just don't report them 

And see what you get-
Cesspools
In Eden
In Eden
No accident-
Just a little of our greed-fueled negligence 

So you've found the proof why
Your cancer rate's shot up
But whatcha gonna do
When we've got all the cards 

Times Beach, Rocky Flats,
Love Canal & Bhopal
Merry Christmas, hostages
From the folks who care 

Cesspools in Eden
Oozing away
Cesspools in Eden
Leak by the day
Cesspools in Eden
Have a nice day",5
"Punk's not dead
It just deserves to die
When it becomes another stale cartoon
A close-minded, self-centered social club
Ideas don't matter, it's who you know
If the music's gotten boring
It's because of the people
Who want everyone to sound the same
Who drive bright people out
Of our so-called scene
'Til all that's left Is just a meaningless fad
Hardcore formulas are dogshit
Change and caring are what's real
Is this a state of mind
Or just another label
The joy and hope of an alternative
Have become its own cliche
A hairstyle's not a lifestyle
Imagine Sid Vicious at 35
Who needs a scene
Scared to love and to feel
Judging everything
By loud fast rules appeal
Who played last night?
""I don't know, I forgot.
But diving off the stage Was a lot of fun.
[Chorus:]
So eager to please
Peer pressure decrees
So eager to please
Peer pressure decrees

Make the same old mistakes
Again and again,
Chickenshit conformist
Like your parents
What's ripped us apart even more than drugs
Are the thieves and the goddamn liars
Flipping people off when they share their stuff
When someone falls are there any friends?
Harder core than thou for a year or two
Then it's time to get a real job
Others stay home, it's no fun to go out
When the gigs are wrecked by gangs and thugs
When the thugs form bands, look who gets record deals
From New York metal labels looking to scam
Who sign the most racist queerbashing bands they can find
To make a buck revving kids up for war
Walk tall, act small
Only as tough as gang approval
Unity is bullshit
When it's under someone's fat boot
Where's the common cause
Too many factions
Safely sulk in their shells
Agree with us on everything
Or we won't help with anythng
That kind of attitude
Just makes a split grow wider
Guess who's laughing while the world explodes
When we're all crybabies
Who fight best among ouselves

[Chorus]
That farty old rock and roll attitude's back
""It's competition, man, we want to break big.""
Who needs friends when the money's good
That's right, the '70s are back.
Cock-rock metal's like a bad laxative
It just don't move me, ya know?
The music's OK when there's more ideas than solos
Do we rally need the attitude too?
Shedding thin skin too quickly
As a fan it disappoints me
Same old stupid sexist lyrics
Or is Satan all you can think of?
Crossover is just another word
For lack of ideas
Maybe what we need
Are more trolls under the bridge
Will the metalheads finally learn something-
Or will the punks throw away their education?
No one's ever the best
Once they believe their own press
""Maturing"" don't mean rehashing
Mistakes of the past

[Chorus]
The more things change
The more they stay the same
We can't grow
When we won't criticize ourselves
The '60s weren't all failure
It's the '70s that stunk
As the clock ticks we dig the same hole
Music scenes ain't real life
They won't get rid of the bomb
Won't eliminate rape
Or bring down the banks
Any kind of real change
Takes more time and work
Than changing channels on a TV set

We knew they were sitting ducks we sacrificed 'em, aztec style so we
Could use their dead meat to cook up war fever back home so make
Sure you take lots of pictures and slant your news our way just like in
Wild kingdom we first tied down the prey we want people boiling for
Revenge in their living rooms so we can go play shoot em up
Anywhere we choose and our backers can cash in without the public
Asking questions

"Got a deadly toy
To brainwash your boy 

An egocentric muscle thug
Kicks butt on screen like a brat out a hell
Bullshitter in the Indochina shop
Pull the string in his back, we win the war 

That we never should have started at all 

A cabbage patch terrorist to call our own
Who rewrites history with a machine gun
Don't think about it-kill it
That's what we teach your child 

Rambozo 
Rambozo 
Rambozo the clown 
To draft age kids
It sure looks like fun-
""kill 'em all
And let god sort 'em out."" 
Like video games-no mess
Just fuel for a mass lapse of common sense
You can be don Quixote
We'll dice you with our windmill blades 

Brawn over brain
Means a happy ending
G.i. Joe in the cereal bowl
Grey shrapnel-flavored chewing gum
Mass murder ain't just painless
Now we've made it cute 

Rambozo 
Rambozo 
Rambozo the clown 
War is sexy
War is fun
Iron ego
Red dawn 
Be a wolverine. you'll rule the hills
Just get some guns and cheerios
Any kid can conquer Libya
Just steal a fighter plane 

Look who came home in a wheelchair
V.a. hospital, they don't care
""we're the machine
You're just a tool.""
Who fell for the myth of Rambozo the clown",6
"If only people could shrink
Our world wouldn't be so overcrowded
Bring ourselves down to size
There'd be so much more food to go 'round 

Why don't we build a machine
With all the know-how of the industries
We put a man on the moon
On earth we'll need more room to breathe real soon 
Oh 

Drink your vaccine and let's shrink
And bring your poodle so it doesn't eat us
The roads will be so wide
No traffic jams when we're half a foot tall 
Bring what you need down here
We'll shrink it all by microwave
Don't want to die like dinosaurs
We'll have enough resources to go round 

Oh 

So now you've made the big shrink
Meanwhile we'll keep acting big
We well-bred beautiful people
Who says we have to go too? 
Cops and Mason businessmen
Were exempted from the ovens
As if you weren't already.
The rest of you are all our termites now

Cheap escape to that mind-control beat

See the macho cock-rock metal heroes
Vomit fire out of their big mouths
Shake your fists obediently
Make Leni Riefenstahl real proud 

See the Aryan bozo with the red guitar
Parachute on the White House lawn
Gonna bomb the commies with his air guitar
So dumb he can't drive 55

Triumph of the swill
Triumph of the swill
Triumph of the swill 

Music is banned in Khomeini's Iran
On the grounds that it stimulates the brain
We've done him one better in the land of coke & honey
Using music to put people's brains to sleep 

Ever wonder why commercial radio's so bad?
It's 'cause someone upstairs wants it that way
If the Doors or John Lennon were getting started now
The industry wouldn't sign 'em in a million years 

So what do we get
GOVERNMENT MUSIC
Christian censorship and taxed blank tapes
Shoppers strung out on our false hopes
Will flock to obey

"Seems like the more
I think I know
The more I find I don't
Every answer opens up so many questions anarchy sounds good to me
Then someone asks, ""Who'd fix the sewers?""
""Would the rednecks just play king
Of the neighborhood?""
How many liberators
Really want to be dictators
Every theory has its holes
When real life steps in
So how do we feed
And make room for
All the people crowded on our earth
And transfer all that wealth
From the rich to those who need it

[Chorus]
Where do ya draw the line
Where do ya draw the line

I'm not telling you I'm asking you
Ever notice hard line radicals
Can go on start trips too
Where no one's pure and right
Except themselves ""I'm cleansed of the system.""
('Cept when my amp needs electric power)
Or-""The Party Line says no.
Feminists can't wear fishnets.""
You want to help stop war?
Well, we reject your application
You crack too many jokes
And you eat meat
What better way to turn people off
Than to twist ideas for change
Into one more church
That forgets we're all human beings
Where do ya draw the line?
In Toronto someone blew up
A cruise missile warhead plant
Ten slightly hurt, four million dollars damage
Why not destroy private property
When it's used against you and me
Is that violence
Or self-defense
You tell me

Why doesn't he want tons of friends?

"Greetings:This is the Secretary of War at the State Department 
Of the United States
We have a problem. 
The companies want something done about this sluggish 

World economic situation
Profits have been running a little thin lately 
And we need to stimulate some growth
Now we know 

There's an alarmingly high number of young people roaming 
Around in your country with nothing to do but stir up trouble 
For the police and damage private property. 
It doesn't look like they'll ever get a job

It's about time we did something constructive with these people
We've got thousands of 'em here too. They're crawling all over
The companies think it's time we all sit down, have a serious get-together-
And start another war

The President? 
He loves the idea! All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro
Napalm
People running down the road, skin on fire

The Soviets seem up for it:
The Kremlin's been itching for the real thing for years. 
Hell, Afghanistan's no fun
So whadya say?

We don't even have to win this war. 
We just want to cut down on some of this excess population
Now look. Just start up a draft; draft as many of those people as you can. 
We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on, 

Hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use 
An automatic rifle and send 'em on their way
Libya? El Salvador? How 'bout Northern Ireland? 
Or a ""moderately repressive regime"" in South America?

We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story 
In the Middle East-we need that oil
We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Khadafy's hit squad 
Didn't even show up. I tell ya

That man is unreliable. 
The Kremlin had their fingers on the button just like we did for that one
Now just think for a minute-We can make this war so big-so BIG
The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper

We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this right. 
Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls
Now don't worry about demonstrations-just pump up your drug supply.
So many people have hooked themselves on heroin 

And amphetamines since we took over, it's just like Vietnam. 
We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong. 
Kept the war functioning just fine

It's easy. 
We've got our college kids so interested in beer 
They don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again. 
Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, 

They wouldn't even know what it looked like
So how 'bout it? Look-War is money. 
The arms manufacturers tell me unless 
We get our bomb factories up to full production 

The whole economy is going to collapse
The Soviets are in the same boat. 
We all agree the time has come for the big one, so whadya say?!?
That's excellent. We knew you'd agree

The companies will be very pleased.",6

Sign says, 'Next sign thirty miles!': 

My pension comes-
Each penny saved buys more escape from home

Tells me just what I like

Shred through Palm Springs across the golf course
Cops 'round here scratching their heads

They're shooting out my tires

I'm looking for victims
Spell of the man with the dogs

And follow you to work

Creep into you
I won't go away

I smile as you frown
And turn to walk away
Your habits for all to see 

I see a shrew
I see you
And the rodent things you do

Yeah and I'm gonna laugh

Saw you again
You'll see me tomorrow

You may not like me
You won't forget me
Not safe even in Walgreen's 

They've seen me

'oh I know him'
Seen but I'm never heard
By your lot 

A stare
Is worth a thousand biting phrases
See how stupid you are? 

I dare you I dare you
To erase my laser tattoo
You see you you see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too 

And I'm gonna crack your mask
Yeah, and I'm gonna laugh

Is it pubic hair
Is it cobweb air

"Ray's guitar broke. No, we won't play Rawhide, won't play anything. 
We'll play the theme from the Dinah Shore show. 
Who wants to be Dinah Shore? Who's alter-ego is Dinah Shore? 
Oh, his fists didn't go up so quickly this time. Yawn, yawn, yawn. 
Put those headphones on, it's be-bop time. 

I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland. 
The night before we played at the Long Goodbye. 
I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night. 
A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night. 
And well, I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this 
bright blue pickup drove up. It had KC lights, tractor tires, 
everything but the CB. It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid, 
right. Well, they drove up to me 
and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell, ""Hey, faggot,"" 
and showered me with some water. 
So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock. 
Now, I waited, walked down about a block to 
where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside, 
and sure enough they drove around again. 
They said, ""Hey, faggot, where's the nearest McDonald's?"" I said, 
""I don't know"" and they squirted me again. 
So I threw the rock and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car. 
They screeched to a halt in the parking lot of some department store, 
who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer, 
and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling, 
""We're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot, we're gonna kill you, 
you motherfucker."" 
So I got in a phone booth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside, 
held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door 
to the phone booth. So they began charging the phone booth, 
beating on it with their club, yelling, 
""We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you, 
you god damn faggot."" I just looked at them. 
So, there was a crowd gathering by this time 
and these kids were standing nearby and they said, 
""Oh, look at him, he's insane."" I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out. 
I yelled at them, ""Take me to a mental hospital right away. 
I want to be be put away. 
Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away. 
Please put me away now."" 
They said, ""Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."" So they called the police. 
The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks. 
He opens up the door, ""Get out of there, you,"" 
throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back. 
Then he goes over to the jocks, ""Now what happened here? 
It looks like we're going have to take him to jail 
but we got to have the full story first"" 
So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole 
Take down on the bass, a little bit down on the bass. Yeah, 
ace in the hole, and they go, ""Well, goddammit, 
the motherfucker put a dent in my truck, a $5000 truck, right, 
so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him. 
I want to kill him. Let me kill him, goddammit. 
Let me kill him."" 
So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home, 
and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence. 
And I thought, so this is Oregon, huh? Tolerant Oregon? 

Ray, are you done with your guitar yet? He isn't done yet. 
So what else do you want to hear, I'm out of stories. 
That's a true story, too. Just ask Bruce Loose",5
"Tonight's the night that we got the truck
We're going downtown, gonna beat up drunks
Your turn to drive, I'll bring the beer
It's an easy shift, no one to fear

Let's ride, ride how we ride
Let's ride, low ride

It's roundup time where the good whores meet
We're gonna drag one screaming off the street

Let's ride, ride how we ride

Got a black uniform and a silver badge
Playing cops for real, playing cops for pay

Let's ride, low ride

Pull down your dress, here's a kick in the ass
Let's beat you blue, 'till you shit your pants
Don't move child, I gotta big black stick
There's six of us babe, so suck on my dick

But the guys at the station, they don't give a shit

Probably:
Right 

There's no one on the streets
And you can't find your hotel
You walk a little faster
Someone's following you 

The wallet-size bulge
In your double-knit butt
Has money for me
And maybe credit cards 

You dart around the next corner
You can't look around
Quick now, fish for the keys for the door
You don't even know where you are 

You walk a little faster

I'll play my music slow
I ain't no artist, I'm a business man
No ideas of my own 

I won't offend 
Or rock the boat
Just sex and drugs
And rock and roll

My Payola!
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola! 

You'll pay ten bucks to see me
On a fifteen foot high stage
Fatass bouncers kick the shit
Out of kids who try to dance

I've lost my guts
I'll laugh and say 
That's rock and roll 

But there's just one problem

Is my cock big enough
Is my brain small enough
For you to make me a star
Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far 

And when I'm rich
And meet Bob Hope
We'll shoot some golf
And shoot some dope 

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?

"There's a prefab building and a funny smell
Around the hill outside of town
Every now and then we wonder
But we shrug our shoulders
And get back to work

There's a railroad there and trains go by
And there's people locked in cattle cars
And have you noticed
The french fries at the A&W
Taste a little strange? 

I drive down to the disco
Pompadour and pink lamme
I bow and blow the doorman
He parts the chain, says join the game 

A quick line in the girls room
To the bar for the electrodes
A coin into the right slits
Tape my temple watch me go 

Now I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Slip my fingers down your Barbie-doll dress
Up and down your spandex ass 

If I lit a match for you 
You'd melt before my eyes
come here my pretty glow-worm
You look so fine to dance with me 

The fly-eye lights are throbbin'
I'm burning up the floor
Whirling twirling
Close my eyes
No faces judging me 

But I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Slip my fingers down your Barbie-doll dress
Up and down your spandex ass 

A Hitler youth in jogging suit
Smiling face banded 'round his arm
Says, 'Line up, you've got work to do
We need dog food for the poor' 

A scream bleats out, we're herded into lines
Customized vans wait outside
I'm getting scared of my new home
To Auschwitz condominiums we go
Oh no 

Now I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Let my fingers down your dress

"Sixteen, on the honor roll
I wish that I was dead
Parents hate me, I got zits
And bruises 'round my head

So I can be like them
Do my homework all the time
I can't go out just then 

People they ain't friends at all
They tease and suck me dry
Yell at me when I fuck up
And party while I cry
I look so big on paper
I feel so fucking small
Want to die and you don't care
Just stride on down the hall 

Suicide suicide
Read the paper, wonder why
Turn the light out, then you cry
It's your fault, you made me die 

Touch me won't you touch me now
So frozen I can't love
When I was born my mama cried
And picked me up with gloves 

Girls, they kick me in the eye
Want answers to the tests
When they get them they drive off
And leave me home to rest 

Hold my head
Make me warm
Tell me I am loved
Give me hope
Let me cry
Make me feel
Give me touch 

The window's broken bleeding screaming
Lying in the hall
I'm gone no one remembers me
A picture on the wall
""He was such a bright boy
The future in his hands:""
Or a spineless human pinball
Shot around by your demands

Goin' to sleep and when I die

Then look down and wipe your eyes
Then go back to your stupid lives

Too drunk, to fuck

I hate what I've become now
I hate that we compromised
Just to grow closer
Say that you're gonna go
See I can't take it anymore
I just can't find a way
I won't lie

One step away from here
and just a moment to go

Is it ok if I close my eyes
As we go further

I want escape from the compromise
As we come closer
Say that you're gonna go
See I can't take it anymore
This is my escape

One step away from here

It's just a moment
One step away...

That you can't find

So I will try and let you walk away

Stop holding it down
Stop thinking it over
Decide and you'll live your life awake
Your body's the seeker
Emotion will lead you
Provided you live your life awake

I know you feel it in the space around you
It's coming round to make a change for you this time
So you can't hide
You're only thinking this a day at a time
You've only ever walked away so make it right.

Stop thinking it over
Decide and you'll live your life awake

Emotion will lead you
Provided you live your life awake

So why don't you live your life today

Suffer reaction
Will you react to me
Over reaction

Got this whole thing underground
I can feel you in every sound
Got your face held up in lights
I see your hand in every little thing
See your mind in every little thing
Your face in line
Not every little thing will go your way

Stop holding it down
Stop thinking it over
Decide and you'll live your life awake
Your body's a seeker
Emotion will lead you
Provided you live your life awake
It's all been in my head

Will you react to me
Over reaction

If I could I would not react to you
If I could I would have no reaction.",5

I tell myself it's a question
The brighter days seem more

You go your way
And I'll go my way
And we've won

It's not worth it
It it's not perfect
And we are not.
For you I can change

I don't know why I tell myself
There's a reason
THe brighter days seem so long ago
Like a re-run

New direction
A new perception
A new day
For you I can change

How can we both be wrong
Caught in a moment
Will we find our way
SOmething we can't control
Back where we were before
Are we just holding on
To find ourselves
And someday we're back
Where we were before

Or are we holding on
To find our way
But somehow we're back
Where we were
Now we're back where we were
You holding
I am holding on
I can change
For you I can change
I Will

I will walk away
Too fast to walk away",5

I'll stand in the middle
A martyr once said
Hoping to deliver us

Take me instead
I'll stand in the middle
When the river runs red

In the hope that my death 
Gives more before oblivion

I'm hoping that the river runs dry yet

I am all of who I am
Wear the face of all I know I am
I am all of who I am
I the tested, I the broken stand

Take me instead
I'll stand unforgiven
When the river runs red
Hoping this delivers us
Defiant, I'll become the shelter 
In the hope that my death 
Gives more before oblivion
Hoping that the river runs dry yet

I am all of who I am
Wear the face of all I know I am
I am all of who I am
I the tested, I the broken stand
On the inside

Born a slave here in denial I am free now
I am just holding my own sacred line
I will keep on following
For the one who bears the eyes I conceived
Mine offered up 
I will brace, bleed and defy 
The moment that the river runs

I am all of who I am
Wear the face of all I know I am
Both the liar and the honest man
I the tested, I the broken stand

I'm hoping to deliver us
Hoping to deliver us
Hoping that the river runs dry",5
"Like a lamb to its slaughter
Buried in water

Down
Under the ground
There's a town there
I've been down there
In the middle of the lake
I hold your hand, for goodness' sake

When the women and the kids are asleep
The walls there
And the skin of the sheep
So lock all the windows and doors
The Devil's coming for you and yours

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live 
They don't bury bodies from the drowned
But they drowned our little town

Like a lamb to his slaughter
Buried in water
Buried in water

Buried in water

When the leaves
Go floating away
In the pale moonlight of day
Iury anchors in our ghosts
And we can let our heartbeats go

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live 
They don't bury bodies from the drowned
But they drowned our little town

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live

I smile at the moon, death is on my face
And if you wait too long
Then you'll never see the dawn again

My skull is full of sunken ships
My heart's a prisoner to my ribs
We're flesh and bone when we're all alone
But together, forever, we'll live

There's gold in my heart
But the winds took my sails through the dark
And if you wait too long
then you'll never see the dawn again

He filled my heart, I did my best
But without the sun, I'm only shadows in a dress
'Cause if the full moon comes, our love is done
So forever, towards dawn, we run",6

Should open her eyes
She'd bid the sun arise

And the great owl flying through the night sky

Dressed like a druid

You'd think a message
Might ring clear

The way it comes the way it goes
If I could see what's given to me
I might not forget so easily

But I don't always see too clearly

Yes, I know
I just can't say the river flows
I'm in the way, the sun's not set

It's not night yet
The water glows purple and blue
Yes, it shows I love you too

"Bad blood stirring in the boiling pot
Finger on the trigger of a gun
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
It's an old web being spun
Born from the seeds of anger and hatred
Do it to them like they do
It's only revenge and the worst of it all
It all comes back to you

Envy treads at the breaking edge
Where dogs begin to wail
Sorrow imprisoned the widows eyes
Like arrows too, they fell
Trying to balance the scales of injustice
Do it to them like they do
It's only revenge and the worst of it all
It all comes back to you

The hounds pursue the weary step
As silver etched the sent
Chasing down the passions of mans convictions
Escaping time he'd never spent
Half starved and running
He'll pay for his blindness
Racing the bullets of hate
Thirteen steps an a dead mans walk
It's always been this way
It all comes back to you",3
"Stranded in the storm trying to see through the rain
Looks like my life's coming 'round again
I wouldn't stop it now even if I thought I could
I was one of the remnants from a burned out scene
Trying to recover from the years between
What they didn't want then is what they think they want now

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

I'd been pickin' up the pieces from another hard fall
Waitin' by the phone for an overseas call
They wanted my past and they wanted it now
I could sense it in the air, feel it in my veins
Something was coming to take me away
I'd been lost for so long, maybe it's the price we all pay

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

I looked in the mirror trying to see
What it was they had killed in me
And why can't I no longer believe
I wandered around and I swore by God
I would never give in no matter how hard they fought
I've waited too long to have it any other way

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago",4
"Well I tried everything
Just to get along with you
And I'm gonna tell you just
What I'm gonna do

Not in knights bridge anymore

We just try to get by
No use in having a plan

We've seen them come and go
There's been so many i know
We used to feel like that a long, long time ago
We ain't really so different
We're all walking the line
And baby, we too are running out of time

We ain't the first to be braced
And we won't be the last

It's already gone past

In the blink of an eye

"The last train is leaving, can't you read the signals in my eyes?
I'm standing on the platform waiting for the one they left behind
If I'd foreseen the future, could I or would I have changed a thing?
Down a million miles of empty track just trying to get beyond what people think
And I don't know where I'm at

I'm heading down the hallway trying to find that doorway lost in time
I'd been here once before but through the years it slowly left my mind
I know your out there somewhere , waiting for me just beyond the rise
And if I ever find my way back to you- this time I'll realize
I don't know where I'm at

Imprisoned in a window, passengers looking down the line
I wonder what they're thinking, I wonder what they'll find
As I lit another cigarette watching for the wind across your hair
And for that fleeting moment, I swear, I saw you standing there
And I don't know where I'm at",5
"I used to ride the world thinking I could do no wrong
I used to feel that I could fall and still get on
You've got a way about you girl I don't understand
How you can turn a crowd and still care who I am

I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return
I used to press my eyes into the looking glass
It always seemed to see the future from the past
Your only halfway there before you realize
You need to take a look into this strangers eyes
[chorus] 
I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return
Within a race for courage the clouds were breaking down
We left nothing behind and nowhere to turn around
I had to hold you close just to make it through the night
And we closed our eyes to all the things that might

I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return",5

Fill all the empty spaces that you're falling through
Hold you up when your skies turn gray
Stand by you no matter what they say
You've done the same for me, I'll do the same for you

I'm takin' a chance and I don't know why
Can't do it alone 

I want to know your dreams
The roads that you've traveled and what you've seen
All the good and all the bad
What makes you smile, what makes you sad
Just let me in I'll open up to you

[Chorus] 
I'm takin' a chance and I don't know why
Can't do it alone

I want to rescue you
Make up for everything that's ever hurt you
Be a family and a world in two
Find your course I will follow you
Thank God the search for me was the search for you

Can't do it alone",5
"I tried to tell you that there's always two sides to the blade 
I saw my future cave in from the roots of decay 
The dark cloud started dancing all over the sun 
Whatever it took to make my blood run 

I had a ways to go 
Sorrow that you'll never know 
But lately it's beginning to show 
And I tell myself never again 

The armies of doubt were playing war in my head 
I couldn't recover from the things that they said 
Crash landed in the safehouse under the stairs 
Last place on earth where anyone cares 

Never dreamed I'd fall to this 
Something that I couldn't resist 
And now I just clench my fists 
And I tell myself never again 

Run silent, run deep, run as fast as you can 
Let the rest of the world slide through your hands 
Old habits die hard like a fatal disease 
They cut you so deep, you can never come clean 

I've got a past to pay 
I got demons to face 
I can't just run away 
But I tell myself never again",5
"Is anybody really free, prisoners of
The strange society
Why is it we're forced to be products
Of the new reality
Drifting through time and space
And all the while
Feeling out of place
I'm out of reach
Waiting for the time to come
And every second always on the run
Looking for love once more
Then turning back and closing every door
Thinking that what might have been
Had that itch not gotten 'neath your skin

Praying to an idol sign
Believing this can keep your dream alive
Worried 'bout the waste of youth
Hoping that with age there will come truth
Dying to get out in time
Before the shadows start to cloud your mind

"I've been dragged through the mud
Told I ain't enough
Done a lot of hard livin' in a world that's sometimes cold
I been pitched and taken in
My future's looking grim

Somehow I disconnected along that road
But try as I may
I can never be the same
This time I'm here to stay
Ricochet

Seen the walking side of death
The eyes that never rest
Been waiting in a line for the call that never comes
But kid, don't hold your breath
You're only second best
Ain't personal just business being done

With a paralyzing gaze
I walked onto the stage
Could I really be the outcast coming home
As I turn to look at you
The way you've fallen too
I hope I can take it when it goes",5
"Day after day we threw our cares away
Waiting for tomorrow, never living for today
We lined up in the trenches, holding higher ground
We looked away for answers but nothing could be found

(chorus)
And i swear, we won't keep standing still
Here to take your heat
The rain's about to fall
We're taking to the streets

Day after day nothing ever changed
Was it any wonder we all began to stray
Some of us for money, some of us for fame
Our goals were so impossible no one could take aim

Day after day the hours wore away
Regretting what we'd missed, closer to the grave
We're the broken generation, we don't know who we are
Fought for every losing cause and now we hide the scars",4
"I hear the train a comin'
It's rollin 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since
I don't know when
I'm stuck in folsom prison
And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a movin' on
Down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My mama said ""hey son,
Always be a good boy,
Don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

Well, if they freed me fom this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all
A little farther down the line
Far from folsom prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away",5

You think I don't belong

Remember me

I was in the crowded season
When the leaves began to fall
I was in the mainline then
You were up against the wall
I couldn't see the end was near
You told me what I wanted to hear
It was easy to pretend
Remember me

And as I walked away
The changes that I saw
At once I was sure you'd made it
Just to see me crawl
And I remember you

Sooner or later I swear
I'll be taken on that long hard ride
Down to those sunset towers
Where you can hear lost angels cry
Falling like fire and rain
Back to my seeds again

Remember me
I remember you

Well, I'm like a dog-dog-a-doggy that is on heat
And I been howlin' out loud for some black meat
And while you're out there waitin'
I'm doin' the chasin'
Don't like it, like it.
Am I bark-bark-a-barkin' up the wrong tree?
It should be you for me
And me for me
We should both get together
In somebody's bedroom
And make it, make it

"I'm told my idea of seduction
Is a bit passe'
I hear you like to try it
So I'll try it anyway

I would try anything
I swear I'd try it here and now
I might impress you
With a Rudolf Valentino bow

I tell you to get your attention
I'd do anything
I would work night and day
For all the joy that she could bring

I'd like to be the hunter
Who get's captured by the game
Oh won't you run your fingers through my mane!

I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too!
I've gotta have my cake and eat it
I've gotta have my cake and eat it, too! 

I want fun I gotta run to you 

To me you look just like
A treasure chest of pretty things
I already told
I would buy you ten real diamond rings

Oh let me tell you
I got lots of things that you could use
So don't reject it or I'll get
The love rejection blues

Any wish of yours is my command
I'd pay you money
If you'd only say you'd hold my hand
I'd speak in languages

that only you could ever hear
Oh baby, take me
Won't you please come here!? 

[Chorus] 

I want fun I gotta run to you 

I said I'd pay you money
If you'd only hold my hand
I hear you like to try it
So I go ahead as planned

I hear my smoochie talkin'
Might just be a bit old hat
So I'll watch what I'm sayin'
I don't think you'd go for that

A little birdie told me
That you just might feel the same
If you do then all you have to do
Is call my name

I would do anything
I swear I'd do it here and now
I might impress you
With a Rudolf Valentino bow

He would cut out on the double
At the lifestyle I'm pursuin'

I wanna be a toy
I can't be treated
Like any other boy that you see

Oh it's really no use cryin'
When there's people out there lyin'
Sayin' awful things about me
I gotta bite my bottom lip
And clench my fist
Because a plaything's what I must be

And I could fly away

And I could drive away

You have brought me a lot of things
But the main one that you brought was trouble
You put your finger to the trigger and you
Shot my heart
Well now, I'm really gonna burst your bubble

"Yeah you know, we always tryin to get this money, that's what we do
It ain't easy but I'm tellin you, it ain't hard either
All you gotta do is keep hustlin man, don't ever give up
I don't care what it is, handle yo' biz
Forget about the woulda, coulda, and if I did's
Cause that's just the past, you know it never lasts
And you know how time flies by so fast
Look at rap music, they said it was a fad
But now it's takin' over, and I'm so glad
Cause I never stopped rappin', but that's what I do
If you quit yo' thang, you might never find the truth
I had choices in life, I coulda' did somethin' else
I did what I wanted to, I did it for myself
Now whatcha gon' do with yo' life
People try to tell you what to do, it's yo' life
You better make the most of it, live to the fullest
Think positive and don't dwell on the BULLSHIT
I can't tell you no better
If you thinkin' 'bout quittin', don't ever

Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin'
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't

Comin' up is hard, givin' up is easy
You always get the game from your homey Too Sheezy
I keep it so real, never spit it false
I hope you make it big and if you ever fall off
Remember these words, it's only what you make it
Anything is possible you want it better take it
I ain't talkin' 'bout stealin', felonies'll ruin it
Stupid all I'm talkin' 'bout is takin' opportunities
Doors open up and when you get another chance
Either hold up the wall, or get out there and dance
It's on you, do what you wanna do
You know why everybody always punkin' you
Talkin' shit they know you're bluffin', won't do nothin'
Sittin' on the shelf like Stove Top Stuffin'
I know you had enough and want to call it quits
Believe me, this ain't it

Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin'
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't

Isn't hard to see, use your eyes
It's time to tell the truth, cause we through witcha lies
Utilize all your steppin' stones, gotta be prepared
Sittin' 'round dreamin' how you bout to be a player
The years and the time fly, you ain't even workin'
Went by overnight you went from 18 to 30
Nothin' goin' on, never set a goal
Dreams can't come true, and now you gettin' old
You start to represent, everything you hate
But don't give up, cause it's never too late
All you need is a plan, a purpose and a motto
And quit livin' life like you 'bout to hit the lotto
Get rich on your own, buy a new home
Keep your real friends, leave them haters alone
I see you when you get there, rollin' to the bank
I know you cain't let go, I know you cain't

Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin'
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't

Nah we can't give up, gotta keep hustlin' for life baby
It's hard on the black man, tryin' to get my stack together why know?

"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",5

Your sweet nature darling
Was too hard to swallow
I got the solution

And stare into your eyes
I see safety there
I want surprises

What I really need to do
Is find myself a brand new lover
Somebody who lies with me
Who doesn't notice all the others

When you wake up tomorrow
You'll be all alone
All the love that we had
I have quickly outgrown
I wanted to stay
But I just couldn't do it
Couldn't stand there
And put you through it

My other loves will tell you
That I'm nothing but a pleasure seeker
And for once I really must agree
I need to leave you by yourself
And go in search of someone else
To satisfy my curiosity

Was too hard to swallow
I made my decision I'm leaving tomorrow

Your sweet nature darling
Was too hard to swallow",6

Is the direct result of drinkin'
In a heavy mix of intimate atmosphere

Is insecurity revealin'

And I would be much safer honey
If I could get this stuff for money

'Cause I'm hooked on love
I never ever felt like this before
If you tell me this is love
I better find a good supplier
I simply got to have some more

I was happy without it
Hardly ever thought about it
Thought that it was something
That I could live without
And now I am a victim
Of the dangerous addiction
Tried to keep it a secret
But the word got out
And I try hard to take it easy
But I've got to find some face to please me

If you tell me this is love
I better find a good supplier

Of the dangerous addiction
Tried to keep it a secret

And I would feel much better about it

I want you
You want me
Let it be
Please be mine

If you won't say you're mine

Wishin', hopin', prayin' I'd catch your eye
You give lots of special love
But I get disappointed cause they never smile

But what's a boy to do without it
What's a boy to do

Somebody needs
somebody loves
somebody treats me right

Some people like to wait around

To do about it

"I, I, I, I, I, I, I am being haunted

There were hours that I cried
And I think about what might have been
If I'd never meant that wicked way
That my heart broke into pieces that midnight on Halloween

And I can see no fire in your eyes

"Help me
You want me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction

Once upon a time
There was a very serious situation growing
There was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals
And this is the story of their times

Old man Sammy had a farm
Walked the land with the rifle
Most of the time shit was calm
His whole life was maintained off the everyday labor

From the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable
This is how we kept food on this table
(Maxing)
You would have he was disabled by the way he be relaxing
Acting like Mr. Magnificent

But the animals were thinking something different
The sentiment was tension in the barnyard
Throughout the years they had been through mad drama
With the farmer, word is bond

And they all came to one conclusion
They argued there was no way they'd ever be free
If it was up to humans
Therefore the only course left was revolution
Which was understandable

And since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals
They planned a full attack under the leadership of Hannibal
The fattest pig in the pack
The next morning on the farm, everything was calm

Just before dawn but before long
The sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric
Now check it this is when that shit got hectic
Directed by Hannibal, the animals attacked

Old Sam was in a state of shock and fell up on his back
And dropped his rifle reaching in vain
Each and every creature from the field at his throat
Screaming, ""Kill, feel the pain""

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

After they ran the farmer off the farm
The pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn
Hannibal spoke for several hours
But when talks about his plans for power

That's when the conversation turned sour
He issued an official ordinance to set
If not a pig from this day forth then you insubordinate
That's when the horses went buck wild

One of them shouted out
""You fraudulent pigs, we know your fucking style""
Hannibal's face was flushed and pale
All the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal

He felt the same way Sam felt
They took his tongue out of his mouth
And cut his body up for sale, for real
You better listen while you can

It's a very thin line between animal and man
When Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand
What would have done? Shook his hand?
This is the animal in man

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

"Our people are poor, and you know damn well nobody wants to be poor
This play is gonna show how the pigs react when the people start
To take community, control over what belongs to them
And liberate it back (echoes)

Sometimes I just don't care

Murderation, modern hanging education
Price of your life is goin' up it ain't inflation
Incrimination, they got my picture at the station
Elimination, state to state we eatin' by this nation
Them belly full, my trigger finger got pulled
To cut the bull shots'll warm your flesh like wool
These tools for survival make fools out of rivals
Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there ain't another place to run
Eat your own gun, scared because my people never known fun

Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough lah to take my sins away
This E and J be freein' us in it's own special way son
We live for the day, the only way done
The violence in me, reflect the violence that surround me
I choose that wildly Mr. Charley keep his eye on me
To figure my head, but them ass kissin' niggas is dead
We learn the choke holds with fishermen's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin' days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin' for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins, I hope that something is done to them
Problem is they're killing them, it reminds me of something like what
Happened to Lincoln

You ain't even safe wit a full clip
Hustle out on the president's grave
I'm sick of livin' in this bullshit
We down to take it to the full length
Meet us up on Capitol Hill, and we can get up in some real shit

You ain't even safe wit a full clip

"It's all love

I don't eat no meat, no dairy, no sweets
only ripe vegetables, fresh fruit and whole wheat
I'm from the old school, my household smell like soul food, bro
curried falafel, barbecued tofu
no fish though, no candy bars, no cigarettes
only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
exercising daily to stay healthy
and I rarely drink water out the tap, cause it's filthy

Lentil soup is mental fruit
and ginger root is good for the yout'
Fresh veg-e-table with the mayatl stew
sweet yam fries with the green calalloo
careful how you season and prepare your foods
cause you don't want to lose vitamins and miner-ules
and that's the jewel
life brings life, it's valuable, so I eat what comes
from the ground, it's natural
let your food be your medicine (uh huh)
no Excederin (uh uh)
strictly herb, generate in the sun, cause I got melanin
and drink water, eight glasses a day
cause that's what they say

They say you are what you eat, so I strive to be healthy
my goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy
cause true wealth comes from good health, and wise ways
we got to start taking better care of ourselves

Yo, lil' Kadeija pops his locks, he want to pop the lock
But prison ain't nuttin' but a private stock
And she be dreamin' bout his date of release, she hate the police
But loved by her grandma who hugs and kisses her
Her father's a political prisoner, Free Fred
Son of a Panther that the government shot dead
Back in twelve four, nineteen sixty-nine
Four o'clock in the mornin', it's terrible but it's fine, 'cause
Fred Hampton Jr. looks just like him
Walks just like Jim, talks just like him
And it might be frightenin' the Feds and the snitches
To see him organize the gang brothers and sisters
So he had to be framed yo, you know how the game go
Eighteen years, because the five-oh said so
They said he set a fire to an Arab store
But he ignited the minds of the young black and poor

Behind enemy lines, my niggaz is cellmates
Most of the youths never escape the jail fates
Super maximum camps will advance they game plan
To keep us in the hands of the man, locked up

(How are you?) Yo shit is crazy Boo
(Have you been alright?) You know I miss you
(I feel lonely lonely lonely) Yo woman
Can you put some money in my commissary?

Lord can't even smoke a loosey since he was twelve
Nine two five locked up with a L
They call him triple K, 'cause he killed three niggaz
Another ghetto child got turned into a killer
His pops was a Vietnam veteran on heroin
Used like a pawn by these white North Americans
Momma couldn't handle the stress and went crazy
Grand momma had to raise the baby
Just a young boy, born to a life of poverty
Hustlin', robbery, whatever brung the paper home
Carried the chrome like a blind man holdin' cane
Tattoos all over his chest, so you can know his name
But y'all know how the game go
D's kicked in the front door, and guess who they came fo'?
A young nigga headed for the pen, coulda been
Shoulda been, never see the hood again

The ladies is out, lookin' fly, dressed comfortable
I love to wake up, and feel the breeze through my window
Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo
It be days like these, that make life so much easier
Fish thawin' out, Guinness Stout in the freezer
Walk the block at my leisure (my leisure)
Summertime is like a anesthesia
So many pretty things to please ya
The greenery
Beautiful birds, natural scenery
Or even just a infinite sky
We be forever puffin' lah
On the block, or tellin' jokes in the ride (ha ha ha)
When the weather be hot, everybody be outside (whut)
Havin' fun (aight?), eatin' fresh fruits and vegetables
And good food put me in the mood for a festival
Some say the summer make a woman more sexual (s'up, boo)
It's instinct -- that's why my game be right on schedule
I put the great Mother Nature on a pedestal
She always fly, but today, she's exceptional
If I had a chance to make a wish
Every day would be just like this, full of Happiness

Have you ever heard the children play?
Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cuz it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cuz it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life, 'cuz every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (whut)
You can leave your troubles behind

"It's bigger than hip hop
It's bigger than hip hop

Uh, one thing 'bout music when it hit you feel no pain
White folks say it controls yo' brain
I know better than that, that's game
And we ready for that two soldiers head of the pack
Matter of fact, who got the Gat and where my army at?
Rather attack and not react
Back to beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
Whether your project's put on hold
In the real world; these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Against the real world (against the real world)
It's bigger than all these fake-ass records
When po' folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1-2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do, if that don't work, then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame-ignitor, crowd-exciter
Or you want to just get high, then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-crier, agent wit' a wire
I'm gon' know it when I play it

It's bigger than hip hop
It's bigger than hip hop

Uh, who shot Biggie Smalls?
If we don't get them, they gon' get us all
I'm down for runnin' up on them crackers in they city hall
We ride for y'all all my dogs stay real
Nigga, don't think these record deals gon' feed your seeds
And pay your bills, because they not
MCs get a little bit of love and think they hot
Talkin' 'bout how much money they got all y'all records sound the same
I'm sick of that fake thug, R&B-rap scenario, all day on the radio
Same scenes in the video, monotonous material
Y'all don't here me though
These record labels slang our tapes like dope
You can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice, a dream or some substance?
A Beamer, a necklace, or freedom
Still a nigga like me don't playa-hate, I just stay awake
This real hip-hop and it don't stop
'Til we get the po-po off the block, they call it

Ain't no food, clothes, or healthcare
I'm down for guerilla warfare
All my niggas put your guns in the air if you really don't care
Skunk in the air, make a nigga wanna buck in the air
For my brother locked up in the jump for a year
Shit is real out here don't believe these videos
This fake ass industry gotta pay to get a song on the radio
Really though, DP's gon' let you know
It's just a game of pimps and hoes
And it's all 'bout who you know
Not who we are, or how we grow
I rap 'bout what I know, what I go through
What I been through, not just for no dough
Even though the rent due, what I'm into ain't for no dough
Or just no fame, everything must change, nothin' remains the same
Sick of the same ol' thang, it's bigger than bling bling

Hop c'mon, c'mon, my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die

Hip-hop means sayin' what I want, never bite my tongue
Hip-hop means teachin' the young
If you feelin' what I'm feelin' then you hearin' what I'm sayin'
Cause these fake fake records just keep on playin'
What you sayin huh DP bringin' the funk
Let the bass-line rattle your trunk, uh
Punk pig wit a badge wanna handcuff me cause my pants that's tend to sag
Hip-hop means throw up your rag, soldier flag
Whether ridin on the bus or you stole a jag
M-1 mean freedom, burn the cash
Revolutionary love til the day we pass
Will they play it on the radio
Maybe not, maybe so we gon keep it pumpin' though
Everybody know we headed for the whoa, fo sho

Ay dogg that label is that slave ship
Owners got them whips and rappers is slaves
If you really wanna eat you gotta hear the same thing
With the football, b-ball, or if you slangin that dope
Ain't never seen no hope, brainwash video shows be foolin my folk
What the hell a brother gon do though, huh
When the rent due, when the lights and the gas gonna get cut off
Drop them raps or cock them gats
Ain't never had shit ever since we came to this bitch
Why I gotta feel pain to get rich
'Stead of stackin' chips, finna pack them clips

If I, feel it I feel it, if I don't, I don't

Pardon me love but you seem like my type
What you doin tonight? you should stop by the site
We could, roll some weed play some records and talk
I got a fly spot downtown Brooklyn, New York
Now I know you think I want to fuck, no doubt
but tonight we'll try a different route, how bout we start
With a salad, a fresh bed of lettuce with croutons
Later we can play a game of chess on the futon
See i ain't got to get in your blouse
It's your eye contact, that be getting me aroused
When you show me your mind, it make me want to show you mines
Reflecting my light, when it shines, just takin our time
Before the night's through, we could get physical too
I ain't tryin to say I don't want to fuck, cause I do
But for me boo, makin love is just as much mental
I like to know what I'm gettin into

We could have mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat

Yeah, what you know about mind sex?

Before we make love

African princess, tell me yo' interests
Wait, let me guess boo, you probably like poetry
Here's a little something I jotted down in case I spotted you around
So let me take this opportunity
Would you share a moment with me, over herbal tea?
Take a walk verbally, make a bond certaintly
'cause in my hand I bet your hand fit perfectly
And it's like we floatin out in space when you flirtin wit me
c'mon, a little foreplay don't hurt (hmmm)
Imagine my chest under this shirt, your ass under your skirt
It's like walking the hot sands and finding an oasis
Opposites attract that's the basis
Our sex is the wind that separates the yin from the yang
The balance that means complete change, our aim
Is to touch you in a delicate spot
And once we get it started I ain't trying to stop

But first we have mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
Mind sex",7
"We ain't tryin to hear shit for what? (Cash money)
We whole world operating off a (Cash money)
To all my niggas with a whole lotta (Cash money)
Watch yo' back money

You couldn't neva understand how my mind tick
I'm on some old school crime shit
When niggas sold two's to keep the dimes lit
Ain't no rules when these iron shots are stoned dun
This heat burn through your flesh, stright to the bones
I reach for the buddha cess and zone
I probably have a future of stress, stay depressed and be alone
But as far as the present time its on
I represent mine til I return to the S and said I'm dead and gone
Nobody want to be broke and you neither
Put me on the co'na, watch me catch a quick case of cream fever
If you be poppin shit my niggas won't believe ya
Probably punch you in the face and take ya wallet when we see ya
But son it gets deeper 
I'm runnin with a click that's bein' hunted by the grim reaper
To all my peoples in the man keeper 
Let'cha situation be a teacher
Ain't nothin like a education 
When I was locked down I learned about patience and dedication
And not to say shit, unless you need a motherfuckin face lift
And as a youth I was a outcast
Runnin around with ?pelagons? playin war but now it's all about cash

Chorus:

I'm caught up, caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't tryin to hear shit til my got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind its all about cash in a fistfull
I'm caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't tryin to hear shit til my got cash to get
Splash you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind its all about cash in a fistfull

Up late night and upset, and fed up
Niggas comin up wet, I'm dead up
Fuck tryin to your head up
And when it go down, word bond we gotta get up
Too many locked down upstate, son its a set up
My life has sped up, many years I'm straight up
Plenty bears for who ain't here and those who ate up
Test and get sprayed up in the club
We couldn't run it so we take the blade up in the booth
Since we couldn't shoot
We heat it up, losin the shirt, showin the bare chest
I'm blessed, puffin the skunk make me care less
The best that you can do is duck my fuckin crew
If the slugs don't get'cha, lord J'll jig ya
Actin artificial you'll get burnt my the pistol
Before its done, even my guns'll turn to missles
Don't have to blow the whistle on you
'cause everybody knows you
Watch yourself around borderline pyschos
Who know my people gotta hold a mint
Or they ain't worth a cent
How can you represent, if you can't pay the rent
And leave a dent in my life time, I'm caught up in trife crime
In fights you neva know what you might find
We stand firm meanwhile 'cause niggas that seem wild
Be buckin blanks, if they were men they wouldn't fuck with pranks
I leave them niggas alone and stay home
Unitl it cool down as they remember how my tool sound

Chorus

We ain't tryin to hear shit for what? (Cash money)
We whole world operating off a (Cash money)
To all my niggas with a whole lotta (Cash money)
Watch yo' back money

Yeah, we up on what we dealing with
We ain't no criminals
We got the right to have gats
As long as the army, navy, air force, marines got gats
We gon' hold heat, knamsayin?
'cause our army gotta represent for us
Word up
Aiyyo, Maintain (Yeah)
Set that shit son

Forever keeping my shit cocked for drama
Stainless steal, shit is for real
The way these rats is known to squeal, makin' sour deals
Thugs up in to mix with these drugs, caught up in the humble
Bricks and paper by the bundle how the Bronx humble
??? devils get deaded, never regret it, only known to set it
Stealin existence obviuosly ya jetted
Speak the desest, I see the pyramid and eagle
Back of the dollar bill, ill decitful, we consider leathal
God fallin, niggas be ballin, guzzlin alcoholics
Two drinks, too many is like whitey infulltrating your fortress
This is on, we 'bout to form, best prepare for the storm
Ya'll funny niggas quick to ring the alarm
Bomb fell, now a nation is gel
We had to dwell for four hundred or more
The Lord had the right just livin poor
Resurrectin the true and livin back the power
Devils getiin devoured, niggas heard the god holla",5
"You have the emergence in human society 
Of this thing that's called the State
What is the State?  The State is this organized bureaucracy
It is the police department.  It is the Army, the Navy
It is the prison system, the courts, and what have you
This is the State it is a repressive organization
But the state and gee, well, you know, 
You've got to have the police, cause.. 
If there were no police, look at what you'd be doing to yourselves!
You'd be killing each other if there were no police!  
But the reality is
The police become necessary in human society 
Only at that junction in human society 
Where it is split between those who have and those who ain't got

I throw a Molotov cocktail at the precinct, you know how we think
Organize the hood under I Ching banners
Red, Black and Green instead of gang bandanas
F.B.I. spyin' on us through the radio antennas
And them hidden cameras in the streetlight watchin' society
With no respect for the people's right to privacy
I'll take a slug for the cause like Huey P.
While all you fake niggaz try to copy Master P
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street, where the people live
We sick of workin' for crumbs and fillin' up the prisons
Dyin' over money and relyin' on religion for help
We do for self like ants in a colony
Organize the wealth into a socialist economy
A way of life based off the common need
And all my comrades is ready, we just spreadin' the seed

[Chorus]
The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don't never pay enough
So the rent always be late; can you relate?
We livin in a police state

No more bondage, no more political monsters
No more secret space launchers
Government departments started it in the projects
Material objects, thousands up in the closets
Could've been invested in a future for my comrades
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat
Many never come back
Pretty niggaz be runnin' with gats
Rather get shot in they back than fire back
We tired of that - corporations hirin' blacks
Denyin' the facts, exploitin' us all over the map
That's why I write the shit I write in my raps
It's documented, I meant it
Every day of the week, I live in it; breathin' it
It's more than just fuckin believin' it
I'm holdin' them ones, rollin' up my sleeves an' shit
It's cee-lo for push-ups now, many headed for one conclusion
Niggaz ain't ready for revolution

[Chorus]",5
"Intro: (news snippets)
""Let me now turn, to our program for the future...""
""The economy right now, is extremely supportive of the president and his 
policies""
""FBI scientists have found chemical traces, consistent with a bomb or a 
missile, on a piece of wreckage...""
""Police using clubs and tear gas against demonstrators...""
""They called me a mother -(bleeped out)-ing so-and-so...and a white 
facist...like they said, 'you're getting some of your own medicine'...""

Singing:
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our babies
Only truth, can take us...

Verse 1:
You can't fool all the people all of the time
But if you fool the right ones, then the rest will fall behind
Tell me who's got control of your mind? your world view?
Is it the news or the movie you're taking your girl to? (uh)
Know what i'm sayin cause Uncle Sam got a plan 
If you examine what they tellin us then you will understand
What they plantin in the seeds of the next generation
Feeding our children miseducation 
No one knows if there's UFO's or any life on mars
Or what they do when they up in the stars
Because i don't believe a word of what the president said
He filling our head with lies got us hypnotised
When he be speaking in cold words about crime and poverty
Drugs, welfare, prisons, guns and robbery
It really means us, there's no excuse for the slander
But what's good for the goose, is still good for the gander
See...

Chorus:
I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago i woulda been a panther
They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer
The views that you see in the news is propaganda

Singing:
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our babies
Only truth, can take us...
 
Verse 2:
I don't want no computer chip in my arm
I don't want to die by a nuclear bomb
I say we all rush the pentagon, pull out guns 
And grab the intercom, my first word's will be I believe
Man made God, outta ignorance and fear
If God made man, then why the hell would he put us here?
I thought he's supposed to be the all loving
The same God who let Hitler put the Jews in the oven
We don't fall for the regular shit, they try to feed us 
All this half-ass leadership, flippin position 
They turn politcian and shut the hell up and follow tradition
For your TV screen, is telling lies to your vision
Every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch
Running up in niggas cribs claiming that they heard shots
It's a plot, but busta can you tell me who's greedier?
Big corporations, the pigs or the media?
Sign of the times, terrorism on the rise
Commercial airplanes, falling out the sky like flies
Make me wonder what secrets went down with Bob Brown (?)
Who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found?
It's not coincidence, it's been too many studied incidents
It coulda been the Klan who put that bomb at the Olympics
But it probably was the FBI, deep at the call
'cause if they make us all panic then they can start martial law

Chorus:
I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago i woulda been a panther
They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer
The views that you see in the news is propaganda

I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago i woulda been a panther
They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer
The views that you see in the news is muthafuckin propaganda

Singing:
Police is telling lies fooling millions
What are they teaching our kids in these school buildings?
Televised, enterprised in all the killing 
Controlling our lives, this ain't living 
No this ain't living

""uh, we view each other uh, with uh, a great love and a great understanding

"Intro:

""I was born, in a dump
My mama died and my father got drunk
They left me, to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a rusty shack
All i owned was hangin on my back
And Lord knows, how I learnt
This place called Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road, you're dirty and you're filthy
Tobacco Road, gonna get me some dynamite and a crane
I'm gonna blow it up, Lord knows gonna start all over again""

""My mind is the place where I make my plans
 The world is the place where I take my stand
 The beauty of life is mine today
 They cannot take my mind away""

[M1]
Fuck what you heard, I'm from Africa
This ain't no act it's mathematical
Past the black radical
I choose the M1, because it's practical
Nothin was changed, we ain't protected
No names, it's all factual
They push the wrong buttons, count down to detonate
Brooklyn blown away and the world will have to speculate
This is what we learn in the streets, fuck a degree
Believe in none of what you hear and half of what you see

[Stic]
It's like watching your own father smoke crack
I have nightmares on shit like that
No way in hell I'll ever get like that
I seen a lot of shit in twenty-two years
It's like a tour of duty
My life is booby-trapped, it's hard to see the beauty
When your heart is turning ice cold
Cold like your hands exposed to blistering winds
My mother keep her eyes closed, she say she prayin
I listen close to what she sayin 
When she speak of Jesus I ignore it
But when it's practical I'm all for it
You got to think like a soldier
I'm training myself to snatch pistols out of holsters
Discipline keep the mind focused
This whole world is a corn field son
Look out for flying locusts

Chorus (x2)

Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you want to do?

[M1]
You can't walk the streets with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
And if you know the time, give me a sign
Tell me where we draw the line
I got your back if you got mine
My enemy's enemy is my man
One dreadlock is stronger than one strand while the crackers got the upper hand
My comrades stand on lands stolen
Every tooth a golden opportunity
Who holdin my community hostage?
10% ransom, costing us time we lost and some
This is how the plan runs
Thinkin with a fugitive brain
What we do to live is insane
Holdin the weed, healing my membranes
Just like crack, you know it all boils down 
to the dollars-and-cents of it
Niggaz commence to get ? to sentenced to serve terms
Jumping the fence, the black germ is loose
When will they learn?
Psychology

[Stic]
We piss on walls and smoke reefa in the halls
No respect for their laws
I cut your face with a kitchen knife
In gladiator times, man against machinery
The tree bark fatigues help me blend in with the scenery boy
Life is a series of serious choices
Theories is formed from experience, never mysterious forces
Various courses of life can lead to failure
Too much of anything is a trap
My mind snap
Guerilla warfare for two grand
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man...
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man

Chorus (x2)

Bridge

[M1]
When you think of us think of pyramids and pistols
And glimmering gold teeth that shine like crystals
The mind is like a jewel son
Only a fool wouldn't grasp it
Wisdom is a tool, you get blasted
When you think of us think of pyramids and pistols
And glimmering gold teeth that shine like crystals
The mind is like a jewel son
Only a fool wouldn't grasp it
Wisdom is a tool, you get blasted

""Free your mind, and the rest will follow
 Seize the time, no-one is promised tomorrow""

"I was born black, I live black, 
and I'ma die probably because I'm black
because some cracker that knows I'm black
better than you nigga, is probably gonna put 
a bullet in the back of my head!!

Yeah our lives fucked up, no doubt
All this shit we go through every day
Sometimes a nigga don't know what the fuck to do
But see I got my niggas
And we gon organize a people army
And we gon get control over our own lives
And I mean that shit right there from the bottom of my shit
I Ching

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Imagine havin no runnin water to drink
Chemicals contaminate the pipes leadin to your sink
Just think, if the grocery stores close they doors
And they saturate the streets with tanks and start martial law
Would you be ready for civil war
Could you take the life of somebody you know, 
or have feelings for if necessary?
I got cousins in the military
But far as I'm concerned they died, when they registered

[Verse 2]
Yo, this world is oh so cold, I think about my ancestors
Being sold, and it make me want to break the mold
Fuck the gold and the party, train yourself, clean your shottie
Tell me what you gon do to get free, we need more than MC's
We need Hueys, and revolutionaries
The niggas on the streets today, it's kinda scary
The smell around my way ain't roses or strawberries
In fact it's kinda poisonous, bringin out the boy in us
But I'ma stand up on my own, like a man do
Dominate the land and make wealth, like Fu-Manchu
Yes the peoples army stick togehther like glue
We represent the I-Ching, and to this we stand true
Military formation, anyone participation is welcome
Each one teach one, son help son
Just one gun is all it take to get it started
Livin in the wilderness of the west we cold hearted

HOOK 2X:
If you don't think it could happen think again my son
Be prepared for the worst that's yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies and ancient wisdom
Cataclsym, niggas be like fuck the system

I don't want to be no movie star
I don't want to drive no fancy car
I just want to be free, to live my life, to live my own life

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm for peace
But I'll kill ya if ya fuck with my moms or my niece
See we all want peace, but the problem is
Crackers want a bigger piece
Got it where the niggas can't get a piece
That's why police get stabbed and shot
'cause a nigga can't eat if the ave is hot
Locked up you get three hot meals and one cot
Then you sit and rot, never even got a fair shot
That's where a whole lotta niggas end up
My man moms even got sent up, tryin to keep the rent up
When I'm bent up I think a lot about the reason I'm here
I think about the things I fear in the comin years
Ahead of me, I'm ready for whatever they bring though
I'd go against a tank wit a shank for my dreams
And that's my fuckin word
One day the whole world will smoke herb
And niggas won't get took to jail for hangin on the curb

HOOK 2X

(next part of hook)

HOOK",5
"I'm not a hunter but I am told,
That, uh, in places like in the arctic,
Where indiginous people sometimes might, might, hunt a wolf,
They'll take a double edged blade,

And they'll put blood on the blade,
And they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice,
So that only the blade is protruding,
And that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat,

And it will come and lick the blade trying to eat,
And what happens is when the wolf licks the blade,
Of course, he cuts his tongue, and he bleeds,
And he thinks he's really having a good thing,

And he drinks and he licks and he licks,
And of course he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself,
That's what the Imperialists did with us with crack cocaine,
You have these young brothers out there who think they are getting something

They gonna make a living with,
They is getting something they can buy a car,
Like the white people have cars, why can't I have a car?
They getting something they can get a piece of gold,

White people have gold, why can't I have gold?
They getting something to get a house,
White people have a house, why can't I have a house?
And they actually think that there's something that's bringing resources to them,

But they're killing themsleves just like the wolf was licking the blade,
And they're slowly dying without knowing it.
That's what's happening to the community, you with me on that?
That's exactly, precisely what happens to the community,

And instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn handle and blade in the ice
For the wolf,
That what happens is the wolf gets the blame, gets the blame for trying to live,
That's what happens in our community,

You don't blame the person, the victim,
You blame the oppressor, Imperialism, white power is the enemy,
Was the enemy when it first came to Africa,
And snatched up the first African brothers here against our will,

Isss the enemy today,
And that's the thing that we have to understand.",6

T-Town, who wanna ride?
Brooklyn, come on, come on

Sittin' in' the livin' room on the floor
All the pain got me on some migraine shit
But I'm gonna maintain
Nigga got 2 or 3 dollars to my name
And my homies in the same boat goin' through the same thing

Ready for a cake, better plot for the paper
We been livin' in' the dark since April
On the candle, gotta get a handle
My homie got a 25 automatic added to the caper

Nigga get the phonebook look up in the yellow page
Lemme tell you how we fin' to get paid
We gonna order take out and when we see the driver
We gonna stick the 25 up in his face

Let's ride, steppin' outside like warriors
Head to the notorious Southside
One weapon to the four of us
Hidin' in the corridor until we see the beam from car headlights

White boy in' the wrong place at the right time
Soon as the car door open up he mine
We roll up quick and put the pistol to his nose
By the look on his face he probably shitted in his clothes

You know what this is, it's a stick up
Gimme the do' from your pickups
You ran into the wrong niggaz
We runnin' down the block hot with these stacks of boxes
So we split up and met back at the apartment

Hell yeah, yo ain't you hungry my nigga?
Hell yeah, you wanna get paid my nigga?
Hell yeah, ain't you tired of starvin' my nigga?
Hell yeah, well let's ride then
Hell yeah, hell yeah

I know a way we can get paid you can get down
But you can't be afraid
Let's go to the DMV and get a ID
The name says you but the face is me

Now it's your turn take my paper work
Like 1, 2, 3 let's make it work
Then, fill out the credit card application
And it's gonna be 'bout 3 weeks a waitin'

For American Express, Discover Card
Platinum Visa, Master Card
'Cause when we was spooked as shit then we was targets
Now we just walk right up and say, ""Charge it!""

To the game we rockin' brand names
Well known at department store chains
Even got the boys in the crew a few things
Po po never know who to true blame

Sto' after sto' you know we kept rollin'
Wait two weeks, report the car stolen
Repeat the cycle like a like a laundry mat
Like a glitch in the system it's hard to catch

Comin' out the mall with the shoppin' bags
We can take it right back then get the cash
Yeah, get a friend and then do it again
Damn right, that's how we paid the rent

Hell yeah
Time to get this paper
I'm down for the caper
Please steady on

It's a deadly struggle
We all gotta hustle
This is the way we survive

I'm homeless, jobless, times is hard, I'm 'bout hopeless
But I gotta eat regardless
No family to run to I'm 22

My sad story made her feel close to me
I made her feel like it was an emergency
When I came to the crib niggaz couldn't believe
I came back with a big bag of groceries, hell yeah

Every job I ever had I had to get on the first day
I find out how to pimp on the system
Two steps ahead of the manager
Gettin' over on the regular tax free money out of the register

And when I'm workin' late nights
Stockin' boxes I'm creepin' they merchandise
And don't put me on dishes I'm droppin' them bitches
And takin' all day long to mop the kitchen shit

We ain't gettin' paid commission, minimum wage
Modern day slave conditions
Got me flippin' burgers with no power
Can't even buy one off what I make in an hour

I'm not the one to kiss ass for the top position
I take mine off the top like a politician
Where I'm from doin' dirt is a part of living
I got mouths to feed, dawg, I gots to get it

Hell yeah, you down to roll my nigga?
Hell yeah, you ready to get your hands dirty my nigga?
Hell yeah, your woman need money and things my nigga?
Hell yeah, well let's ride then
Hell yeah

If you claimin' gangsta
Then bring on the system
And show that you ready to ride

'Til we get our freedom
We got to get over
Please steady on the grind

If you claimin' gangsta
Then bring on the system
And show that you ready to ride

'Til we get our freedom
We got to get over
Please steady on the grind",5
"Crank up yo speakas

To all my niggaz
Every hustlin nigga
Strugglin niggaz
Revolutionary niggaz
Gangbangin niggaz
Chain gangin niggaz
To ya freaky sick

I refuse to be a stereotype in your box
Never want to try to be somethin I'm not
I'm just a nigga from the block, if you got it twist it
Stay blowin on green, if you got it twist it on up
DP's givin a fuck
RBG'd up in some gangsta chucks
Throw yo fist up homie if you know what's up
All my comrades puttin in soldier work
We rollin dirty wit it
Fully dedicated
So real that the radio will never play it
But that's cool, the enemies supposed to hate it
Freedom ain't gonna come till we regulate it
That's why I'm in the dojo, not just for the video
Really do, we really got beef with the popo
Never know when they gonna put you in a choke hold
This is for you new niggaz holdin for the radio

Chorus:
Turn off the radio
Turn off that bull shit
(repeat 3X)

(telephone rings)
People's Radio
Yo hang up, that's police

What's on the radio? Propaganda, mind control
And turnin it on is like puttin on a blind fold
Cause when you bringin it real you don't get rotation
Unless you take over the station
And yeah I know it's part of they plans
To make us think it's all about party and dance
And yo it might sound good when yo spittin you rap
But in reality don't nobody live like that
You want to know what kinda nigga I am
let me tell you bit the nigga I'm not
I don't fuck with the cops
Platinum don't me that it gotta be hot
I ain't gotta love it even if they play it a lot
You can hear it when you walk the streets
How many people they reach
How they use music to teach
A radio program ain't a figure of speech
Don't sleep, cause you could be a radio freq

People's Radio
I gotta fat chain, I gotta fat whip, I gotta -

"[intro sample vocals from ""American Pimp""]
So much shit goes on it makes me doubt about a God -- you know, makes me ask
well if there is a God then why am I in the situation that I'm in?
Or why is my family going through certain situations
when I don't think that they deserve it nah mean?
Or why do good people suffer so much and bad people prosper so much?

[sample fades out as instrumental comes in]

[lighter sparking]

Yo
Goin out...we light this J up right here...for all the hard working folk
cross this country, cross the world
For everybody on the grind everyday 9 to 5, 8 to 12 -- you know how we do it
Hand to hand, whateva...
Yo, yo..

[Chorus - singing]
I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
I ain't tellin' you nothing you don't already know
I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
Like this world just don't want us to groooow

I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
I ain't tellin' you nothing you don't already know
I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
want to run up in tha white house and kick in tha do' ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
What a nigga gonna eat when the refrigerator empty?
Work all week let the bossman pimp me?
Can't pay no rent till the 15th
Landlord call the police to evict me
Lookin for a job in the want ads
Have you ever been to jail? Know they gone ask
Ever took a piss test that you didn't pass?
In between jobs in the past? How you get cash?
I done worked over hot ass stoves
I done picked up trash off roads
Winter time in the streets and the cold
Many times had to sleep in my clothes on the flo'
What you know bout bein' po' seein' most of yo kinfolk be on dope?
Ain't nobody in the hood got no hope in this fucked up system and that's why we don't vote
Still payin niggaz 4.25 - How the fuck we supposed to survive?
I'm close to the edge, government takin most of my bread
in taxes might as well have this close to my head
Make a nigga want to wild out
runup in the white house with the gauge out, CLICK CLACK!
GIMME MY SHIT BACK BEEYOTCH!

[Chorus]

Puttin' on my uniform, just a number on a W-4 form..

[Verse 2]
See where I'm from it's a few ways out
either rappin or sports either dope or the casket
You can work to the bone but don't put all yo eggs in one basket
We don't never get a piece of the pie
Work 50 years, retire then die
Stay po', rich folks is the criminal
but you don't want to hear me tho' so
thank God it's friday, ain't it what we live fo'?
Nigga gotta get up out the plantation
Same job that my pop had before me
Imma pass it down to my seed fucked up situation
Make a nigga want to wild out
runup in the white house with the gauge out, CLICK CLACK!
GIMME MY SHIT BACK BEEYOTCH!

[Chorus]

My J-O-Beeee

they owe meeee
but got me fillin' out this application

My J-O-Beeee

they owe meeee

"*guitar plays and birds in the background*

(Verse 1)
What you know about the running, the stretching
The cars, the weapons
The path, the journey
The jewels, the learning
The fear, the focus
The aches, the pains
The contact sparrin', the breaks, the sprains
The trial and error, the ranks, and belts
The spiritual growth, the science of breath
The tests, the techniques
The forms, the stances
The flow, the rhythm, the internal answers
The herbs, the healing, the quiet meditation
The truths reveal through daily dedication
The love for the art, the sweat on your shirt
The mind, the body, and the spirit that work
The feelings of failure, the hope to succeed
The battles of questions like ""Should I smoke weed?""

(Verse 2)
The water, the thirst
The cleansing, the blessings
The flash of insights, the teachings, the lessons
The grappling and locking, trapping and boxing
The training and slacking
The starting and stopping
And stayin' committed, when your homies ain't with it
The hours or practice after the class is finished
The cause of your ignorance, flaws in your discipline
Broken laws of nutrition, and pork and dishin'
The vitamins and supplements
Salads and ointments

The kingships, pull joints in doctor appointments
The dues, the pads, the wraps, the gloves
The mouthpiece you left home, the taste of your own blood
The hunger, the blocks
The punches, the squats
The crunches, the example you set for the youngsters
The will, the skills, the kill or the hill
The separation between what's fake and what's real
The laws of physics, The class ""comradery""
The vows of humility, the bow, the courtesy.

Self defense doesn't mean you run and attack someone
But you do have the right to defend yourself by any means necessary

Dead... prez... dot... com
Information news

Everywhere we go
Every day on TV
They be talking about
Who you gonna vote for
You got a black man running
But I wonder if he get in
Who he gonna open up the door for?
I don't wanna to discourage my folk
I believe in hope
I just want us to want more
Politics is a game
How they keep us contained
There gotta be more that we could hope for
Democrats and Republicans
Just 2 sides of the same coin
Either way, it's still white power
It's the same system
Just changed form
You wanna vote? please do!
Cast your ballot, let your voice be heard
But what I do want to say is
After the election
You'll see
Mark my words

[Chorus]
It's politic time again
It's politrick time again
It's politic time again
It's politrick time again

Shoot the messenger!

This is the most important election of all time
The government's committing the biggest of all crimes
These bullshit politicians say they speaking for the people
Before they ran for office, they were shitting on the people
Billion dollar campaigns
Trillion dollar bailout
Anybody know the definition of a sell-out? huh?
And if Obama win, he wouldn't be the first black
Take your 2 dollar bill and turn it over to the back (you see? right there)
But with the TV on, you only hearing they voice
The system is broken, they trying to beat a dead horse
Go ahead and vote for the lesser of two evils
I plot, plan, and strategize with the poor people
The middle class will say this opinion is irresponsible
But if you ain't got no healthcare, they kickin' you out the hospital
McKinney, Clemente, off in the Green Party
No disrespect, we need a Red, Black, and Green Party
Like Marcus Garvey's

[Chorus]

Even if Obama wins
Uncle Sam ain't my friend

It's politrikkks time again
It's bullshit time again

The time is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor
And truth is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor
You'll see it. You'll see terrorism",5

On the road with my bad friends. 
Stop to look at the tragedy. 
On the road. 
The road to nowhere. 
I'm missing all these things. 
That I left on the side of the road. 
I didn't lose but misplaced my mind. 
And I gave a sentimental sacrifice. 
And all the things that you do. 
Confuse you. you're my charity. 
I hope you see. 
And on the drive home. 
The light put the innocent on your face. 
And I'm stuck with my bad things. 
Am I going straight to hell. 
And all the things that you say. 
Get in the way. 
You're my charity. 
I hope you see. 
And all the things that you do. 
Destroy you. 
You die for the truth that you lose. 
Stop driving me on the road. 
The road to nowhere",4

As I say nothing to you

Of all the things my love, won't you listen to me.
When I say
It takes one more chance to survive.
And to say that'd be easy, that's a lie.

When you are sorry for it all.
And I care.
Nothing is my fault.
You're leaving as I say nothing to you.
As I say nothing to you.

They've told me never let go who I am.
I am.
So hold me and promise that I can't.
So hold me forever never change.
Never change.
So hold me never.

It takes one more chance to survive.
Now to say that that'd be easy, that's fine.

When you are sorry for it all.

"We're leaving tomorrow
We'll travel on through the morning light
Leaving in sorrow
Carrying something that must get through

So many waiting
To hear the news that I have for you
Won't be relating
Though it is something that you once knew

If I tell you I'm not afraid
I'd be lying to you
Peace from inside
That I'm trying to get to

Will be lighting my way
Let in the light
And the dark leaves you

I'm gonna let it be known
I'm gonna let it be shown
I'm gonna set it free

I'll be on my way

We're Grieving tomorrow
Leaving our home for the circus life
It has to mean something
Could never mean more than its sacrifice

So many wondering
Why we have come from so far away
Only to bring you something
Something already inside of you

The heart is the temple of feeling
The mind is the cage of the soul
The people are blind 
That you follow behind
Leading you over the edge 
And into the hole

Singing tomorrow
The unholy verse of this threnody
Ringing in sorrow
Bells of the new fallen sacrilege

News of the world from a second sight
The pounding of hooves and black wings
Burden the beast of our own device",6

Into the sky
The mother ship that's headed for Heaven
Soon passing by

They'll fly us to the Sun

Waiting for the day
To wash it all away
You'll be waiting your whole lifetime",7

We rise on the wings of flame
And now we rise
We rise on the wings of flame
Nothing holding us back
As we rise on wings of flame
Momentum pushing forward
As we rise on wings of flame
We are fireborn
As we rise on wings of flame
We are the Phoenix
As we rise on wings of flame

"They met in the dark of the night
For a final time, for the great showdown
Two dreamers deciding which path to take
One for their future, one for the present

I was standing strong until you showed your face
To ruin and ravage everything we've planned
Your dream is empty with its promise, your self fulfillment
The future holds so much more for us

One of us will die before this is over
One of us will die before this is over

The sword of vengeance glistens in the moonlight
Her words fall silent as he makes his attack
Now we will find out who truly holds the power
I'm waiting for you to relinquish your hold
There is no room for us so you must be destroyed
Then I'm afraid this is unavoidable

His blade plunges deep cutting down to the core
And with her last gasp for breath
All her dreams and aspirations fade
She pleads for him to see, to see, for him to see the truth

And with one final slice she's gone forever
No more dreams, no more tears, she's gone
And with one final slice she's gone forever
No more dreams, no more tears, she's gone

Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries
Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries
Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries

He stands there victorious and alone
Suffering through what he himself has made
Without her, there is no point to my fight
He sees it all as it slowly begins to fade

One of us will die before this is over
One of us will die before this is over

He realizes now without her
Life loses point
Without the battle, without their struggle
Life loses point

He has no purpose now
Life loses point
As everything fades, everything fades
Life loses point

The struggle was keeping us both alive
The struggle was keeping us both alive
The struggle was keeping us both alive
The struggle was keeping us both alive

"The hands of time
Are frozen in this moment
I can't spit it out
For fear has overtaken my voice

Waiting seems impossible
Different stages
Waiting seems impossible
Different stages

Waiting seems predictable
Different ideas
It is I that will have to live with this
I, betrayer of hearts, I, servant of sorrow

Hear I am, the worthless king
Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless king
Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless king
Join my legions of useless

Wandering the great depths
Searching the canyons for truth
Discovering every darkness
Bringing its ugliness into new light

It's come down to this, all or nothing
Our choice, decide, decide our suffering
It is I that will have to live with this
I, betrayer of hearts, I, servant of sorrow

"Oh, another face joins the crowd
It's time to impress, time to prove yourself
You don't realize
That in a year's time you'll be over this

Moved on to the next trend
Your next catchy melody
Moved on to the next trend
Here's your next catchy melody

So, say what you will
And do what you feel you must
Your words just fuel my rage
And fill my heart with disgust

I know what really matters
And I know who will be there
The rest of you could wither away
And not a piece of me would care

Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing

Damn thing, you're spread so thin
We see right through your display
A procession of smoke and mirrors
Tomorrow none of you will mean a goddamn thing to me

In time everything grows stale and old
I'll hold on to what I have and never let go

Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing

"Cold hands feed us death while war breeds in every breath
It seems like we have nothing left and our ways are set
The sacrifices we endure perfection we pursue
Darkness, nothing pouring through like Harkonen vision

All will fall before us and all will be made to suffer
Born, scream, confusion, pain, insanity
Reborn into this fleshen form
Forced through the portal of the womb

Fear is the mind killer, I'll face my fear
And allow it to pass through me
Cold hands feed us death while war breeds in every breath
It seems like we have nothing left and our ways are set

All will fall before us and all will be made to suffer
A vision of light, a survivor of death
Death, scream, confusion, pain, insanity
Return to the source where it all began

I can't make any sense of it
Not in the way you demand
Fear is the mind killer

I'll face my fear and allow it to pass through me
It is by will alone I set my mind in motion

Someone's head comes crashing through the door
This party?s really getting out of control
The insides of the fridge are nailed to the wall
No shit, that dude who lives here looks fucking pissed

Pain is all my head will feel when I wake up
I don't care, so pour me out another fucking cup

This could be the best night of my life

This party is out of fucking control
My mom is gonna kill me when she gets home
Are you serious? What the fuck?

Someone threw a brick into my TV
It wasn't us, we were all outside smoking trees
Where's my phone? I'm gonna call the fucking cops
Aw, fuck it, I'm way too drunk, so let's all do another shot

Let's all violate what I feel when I wake up
Watch your dress, somebody [Incomprehensible] the fucking cop

The night is ending 'cause the sun is comin' up
Does anyone have a lighter to spark up these blunts?
The party was totally insane, I'm gonna pass out in the van

He said he was a friend of mine,
his face had changed since he'd done his time.

After a drink he began to smile,
and laughed and said 'The world's his prison cell
Somewhere between Heaven and Hell

the lamp flickered and the house groaned.

About a man who will visit you,
with haunted eyes to collect his due
He was a tax-collector like Matthew,
and if he comes he comes for you.
And if he comes he comes for you.

This is a holy place

I slowly tried to excuse myself
went for the keys on the back bookshelf
And when I went to turn around,
he was standing there holding my keys in his hand.
He said ""You think you can get away? 
Don't you know this is judgement day?""
And I said ""I won't except that fate"" and I had no time to hesitate
I had no time to hesitate

And we say prayers to Jesus
Because Jesus has felt our pain

Lonely people just like Him

the lonely people playing with their toys

Lonely people feeling blue
Lonely people just like you.

Or gonna take you out.

Phoenix was an Indian who had a knack for robbing banks
In the mesas of New Mexico is where they made their plans
To rob the Denver bank and to leave no one alive
And with their plans they rode northeast, their fingers on their guns
Looking for an angel or the pale rider to come
Looking for an angel or the pale rider to come

There back in Santa Fe, where you will find my love
A Spanish maid named Isabelle, with skin like holy dove
And if this plan goes bad, and I should meet my end
You send her Texas and make sure to treat her well

He vowed to catch the riders, he vowed to see them hanged.
He told his men ""Be ready and when you see the rider's come,
Put a bullet between their eyes"" and the pale rider he comes
A bullet between the eyes and the pale rider he comes.

On the Denver horizon, that's where it all went down
Getting into to focus as the riders dust settled down
Connor had the street staked out and ready for the draw
And the tension mounted in the heat of it all
Connor said ""Don't worry, I'm scared to death myself
When I look into his eyes I see a demon straight from hell!
Coming straight for me - coming for the kill""

Selling romance of riding into Mexico.

And the gamblers lost in Vegas, don't believe it anymore

You feel the spirit moving and its hard to fail.

To beat the other's to the place where
Three women
all working for the mighty peso, can't seem to let it go

And the water is washing over me.

"They used to tell me I was building a dream
And so I followed the mob
When their was earth to plow or guns to bear
I was always their right on the job

They used to tell me I was building a dream
With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread?

Once I built a railroad, I made it run
Made it race against time
Once I built a railroad, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?

Once I built a tower up to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?

Once in khaki suits, gee we looked swell
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dum
Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum

Say, don't you remember, they called me ""Al""
It was ""Al"" all the time
Why don't you remember, I'm your pal
Say buddy, can you spare a dime?

Once in khaki suits, ah gee we looked swell
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dum
Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum

Oh, say, don't you remember, they called me ""Al""
It was ""Al"" all the time
Say, don't you remember, I'm your pal
Buddy, can you spare a dime?",6

I had to see you again
Can't understand it 
Just want to feel you again

And maybe you think I'm sinking, but you just can't get inside
Don't try to save me when my mind is finally free
'Cause I'd rather run my own world than face your reality
It's not enough for me to paint with black and white
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life
You think you travel far and never seen the stars
'Cause the only the way is if I say you can follow me that far

I might be broken but I will rise again

Broken, I will rise again

And I just hope one day you will feel

From the bottom of your heart you must confess

Leave words unspoken
Sometimes it's better to keep things rolling
Hide em somewhere
In a place where no one hears em

Catch em, hide em, swallow them, get rid of em
Get used to that, get used to that

Before you spit words out and you regret every single one you lose
Always remember the meaning cannot be turned
You will try to make things undone but this chance does not exist
You must confess, you better

Leave words unspoken
Sometimes it's better to keep things rolling
Hide em somewhere
In a place where no one hears em
Leave words unspoken

If you will ever change your mind
You would regret that you didn't

Leave words unspoken
Keep words in the shadow of your mind
Bind them to your heart and take em to the grave

Leave words unspoken
Sometimes it's better to keep things rolling
Hide em somewhere
In a place where no one hears em

Trust me I know because I regret",5

We all have a resolution
That we never end up making

I'll do it once
And my mouth's wide open

Now I'm here again
Another fuck
With a monkey controlling me

I can't get myself away from this
It keeps calling me
I can't get myself out of it
I keep falling

Your scent enlivens me
And you've made me bad
Cause you made me your fiend

I want to seep into you
My existence has failed
I'm broken

I only live through you
Another fuck
Who has no hope YEAH!

You keep calling me
You keep calling me
You keep calling meI'm your fiend

"Tonight I've made the wish
That never comes true
Just seems to vanish in the end
It always dies before it begins to bloom

Obscurity it appears
Sorrowful behind a veil of tears
This wish with an untimely end
I'm bleeding again

I don't want this I am more than nothing
This heart serrated
I don't want this I am more than nothing
Tonight you're bleeding me
For now
You're bleeding me
For now
You're bleeding me
And this heart serrated

I've made the wish a poisoned kiss
It never came true into nothingness
As I pretend this trust I mend
Lying here bleeding again

I don't want this I am more than nothing
This heart serrated
I don't want this I am more than nothing
Tonight you're bleeding me
For now
You're bleeding me
For now
You're bleeding me
And this heart serrated
Bleeding me

I don't want this I am more than nothing
This heart serrated
Your sympathy
Your sympathy
My misery
I don't want this I am more than nothing

"Through the mind we flee to space
As the shadows choose the place
Though afraid, my sleeper must awake
So I've used up all and left this time 

Station
Towards where we're falling
Faces
Glowing blue eyes upon me 
Waste us
Or make us slaves till death like upon me
Or turn around and fake they're proud
I've found my true calling 

Well beyond the mortal plane
Lies the place where one's life can be exchanged
No more conscience, no more pain
The now, the past, the future stay the same 

Station
Towards where we're falling
Faces
Glowing blue eyes upon me
Waste us
Or make us slaves till death like upon me
Or show the world exist without the day
While the tall one tries convincing us to stay

"Now you know When I couldn't grow Places where I live Downward you'll soon drift On the sailless boat Nothing left to give All I see is throat Flowing glower Witless knower Seedless sower Will you realise? If it's all a lie Right before we die My soul leads to the wrong Now that I bleed a song Changeling of the night Purely based on fright I have this new sight Sad with my face so long Flowing glower Witless knower Five steps lower If I tell a lie Will you realise? Numb the pain Way high and real low Now it feels the same Hollowed out with shame Have love or feel so With my brand new name Hoping to see the day Flowing glower I'm bipolar Seedless sower If I die tonight Then in time you'll find Will you be alright? Quest your heart and mind Thirst becomes boring Over space and time Now that we're soaring All you are is mine Done with exploring Flowing glower Ruthless flower Breathless blower If it's all a lie Will you realise?

"A morbid beauty
Glows in resonation 
Mercurial signs they read 
Make real our minds True fascinations 
For now we're rolling
And kinda golden 
As time keeps folding We're old when our poor souls depart 
Whereas cold cruel jokes now make you cry One day you'll take them in your stride
All of the time we've resided here 
You'll see our chalices rise With ever endless tears
And illusions they fly But someday soon will clear 
Just sit back and recline I'll guide you through the years 
Through the future years 
As they'll soon appear 
Someday all too near 
Now the distance clears 
Bad ways which rule all the ways we go 
Through black and the gloom 
Consecutive days and plain afternoons 
The things in life They pass the time While those all around are bored 
Though we come down in real demise
Trek through all of the feelings with no tears in eyes 
Kept fear veiled so it hides 
Life's never forced or dry 
So there's nothing inside me I just seem alive 
To the future years 
As they'll soon appear 
Dressed in slacks as we will 
So its stars they steer 
Just tie a silk sheet round your neck 
And twist it till your face turns cherry red 
All of the time we've resided here 
You'll see our chalices rise 
With ever endless tears 
And illusions they fly
But someday soon will clear 
Just sit back and recline I'll guide you through the years

"Laid awake throughout the night
Today the school's so loud
And now it's all so quiet
I plan to pack light
'Cause tomorrow we'll fly
Taking off to a place
A land that's not so far away 

The boat above our heads for the walk to the shore
As feelings of dread soak the length of the oar
Connecticut hillsides surround the clouds soar
Dazed to the signs
I think back to times when gender crossed me 

Miss all those Christmases
And the once careless Autumns 

Though there's space betwixt us which
Dissolves here round when the fog clears 

As we crept through the race
Old friends would line the banks
Cheering on as they played
Screaming all the lovely names
Then they'd start to file away
Come dust the time to rage 

The boat above our heads for the walk to the van
As luncheon awaits us while all the girls tan
And social engagements commence by the sand
Now our day is complete
We faced defeat, but felt the cool breeze 

Follow our dreams
And hold the lake in such dear regards
Against the best we thrusted
But the justice came when the bow touched",6
"The desperate eyes are closed maybe it goes away
Please rest tomorrow and bring a satisfied day
The restless urge of love that's worth the burning for
Surely it's that one comforting love to give you more
And that thought can be that begins the brand new tangled web your spinning
Anyone can be a brand new love
Any time the force can be broken to tear you bitter world to be open 
Anyone can be a brand new love

You won't be the first
Your twisted change is normal, gossip dirt
Whisper to the nodding head, thrilled you fell apart instead of them, but they will
'Cause any hope for love an be killed
If you need a different face, it's definite time to destroy this place

Follow what you feel you alone will decide what's real
Anyone can be a brand new love",6
"We gather today, with ill invitaion.
To commence here under the sun, a black congregation.
Some know me the hellion, the stranger among us.
Some know me the maggid, in moments the malign Alumnus.
Throughout my tenure, my time in the mansion, a coven arose,
Descendants truly Urantian.
Now please listen close, divide your attention.
An honor presides the
Negus has yet failed to mention.
We've altered the premise and renounced the maxims.
Low and behold the first row tears the Gog,
Alas the sky falls, rain the angels.

"How the story rolls
Magic's taught and history's told
A glory hole
Which through gazed her eyes of gold
Those veins run cold
Mystery's wife evades her soul
Scaring to and fro 

Tearing through the snow
As she makes her darling coat
Hoarding all the shawls
Now her evil highness rose 

Kind of like Shakespearean prose
Without the rose
Avid as she sows
Cruella grows
Horace and Jasper stole
So let the horror flow 

Black and white in hair
Elegantly gaunt in frame
A boney flare
Which christened Cruel with creepy grace
Always smokey air
Circling one lurch, Hepburn face
In her head which filled the space
Was the one hellacious taste
As she aims her fate
Nothing flees her sore embrace 

As the biggest mistake that Cruel ever made
Was when she left her cave and started to reign
As the love for her fades
Our feelings won't change
So my darling Cruella
We see through the grey 

In her cold glare
Loveliest and rare
Frightened you'll soon wear
And this elegantly haunting is so fair
There's no reason to part from her cold lair
She has all of the loveliest and rare 
Things which frighten at first
But she'll soon wear 

She's a regional spark from this nowhere
And this elegant loveliness so fair
Taking strolls through the dark by the moon's glare
As she listens for barks in the night air
Always searching for marks on the white hair 

Cruel, you're so fair

"I got the key, key to Gramercy Park

Every night
Looking for the fight
Thoughts on the left
The action's on the right
As you know, the id wasn't meant to be starved

Face white
Revenge of the Hittites
When you're inside
And you thought to take a walk in the park
Think someone is about to be carved

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find the key to Gramercy Park

I got the key, key to Gramercy Park
Where it's safe to be afraid of the dark
Maybe there we'll fuck by the heavenly stars
But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find the key to Gramercy Park
In the other time of mother speed
Through evil eyes and make believe
To where we bare the supremacy mark

And never look at the other place
Stay with what's pristine that touches you
Where the peril accentuates
Something that could mean so much to you
Try save a seat in the golden cage
The media mass has still yet to say
To simply pass or rise from the grave

Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park
Out of my way and I'm safe, not afraid of the dark
Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park
But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars

"It was November, and I was a mess
And I was thinking of leaving her back then
As if by magic, you and I met
And it brought me back to life again

You've got a certain something about you
And I've got a past I want to leave behind
It's been a long, long time since I met someone
Who made me happy to be alive

Now the bell's of St. Paul's ring out in my head
Like the last few words she said

I can't go back to living in silence
No, I can't go back to sleeping alone
All the years she made me live as a liar
Ended up becoming all that I know

And I know you can't stand winters here
You said you never felt that kind of cold
I guess when you're from another hemisphere
It can sometimes feel like another world

You've got a way of making me hang on
To every single word you say
We stay up all night talking shit about
How I needed to get away

Now the bell's of St. Paul's ring out in my head
Like the last few words she said

I can't go back to living in silence
No, I can't go back to sleeping alone
All the years she made me live as a liar
Ended up becoming all that I know

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

You've got a certain something about you

"So tired, of being tired and drunk and lonely
And I hate myself in the morning
Yeah so much more in the morning

When the guilt swirls in my stomach
And my heart beats through my ears
And all the little things that I ignore
They seem to be more real

I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go

And all the records
I've been playing, they tell me to stay this way
And all the ones I love give up on me
They try their hardest and fail so miserably

I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
My heart was fast but your hand was quicker and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go, it all go

My timeline is running out fast
My future will never be my past
And I still can't work out how to make my money last
And all the things I thought that I could be
Get less and less as each new day begins

I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go
I held the gun but you pulled the trigger and we watched it all go

"There's a weight that's on my shoulders
Empty space inside
All the things our parents told us
Never truly leave our minds
All that tracks we form as children
And the habits that we've built
Only worsen as we get older, leave us unfulfilled

All the time that I wasted
Refusing to let you go
From every place I've been to the state I'm in
I needed to let you know, that you're not my home

Would I still feel awkward sober
Around people I don't know
Would I still not swim in public and hide behind my clothes
I guess the white skin that I'm covered in, and the country where I was born

All the time I wasted
Refusing to let you go
From every place I've been to the state I'm in
I needed to let you know

When I've had enough of the way that my face turns red
I said my minds made up
Yeah I've had enough, oh England get out of my head

'Cause the world isn't all just a vampire, England just might be
'Cause it wears me out, drains the joy

And it must be love
That holds me down so well
'Cause the guilt that should be eating at my conscience isn't there
I took a step back into the dirt I think I'm crying for help

I recall, love
Not a single word was said between the both of us
As I crept towards the door to let myself out
Oh I tried to wash away the filth
But the images were burning my mind

I took a step back into the dirt and I'm not proud of myself
And it must be love
That holds me down so well
'Cause the guilt that should be eating at my conscience isn't there
I took a step back into the dirt I think I'm crying for help

And it must be love
Must be love
Must be love
Ooh it must be love

It's not me no, it's not me

And I knew if I let you go to waste
I'd never forgive myself
So I sat back, enjoyed my time
Drinking till the morning
Laughing with your Dad
I knew that his would be the hardest goodbye

And I want you to notice
And I wish you would care
I just wanted to feel like something's there
I just want a reaction
Yeah something to feel
Or a single emotion that seems real

I turn with it all in my head
As I stumbled 'round the city where your Grandfather died
And I got lost in all the alcohol
Open skies and antidotes
Those good ol' boys could charm me all night

And I want you to notice
And I wish you would care
I just wanted to feel like something's there
I just want a reaction
Yeah something to feel
Or a single emotion that seems real

I wonder if my name is still written on the wall

There's a girl I love back home, she shares my pain

'Cause the life that chose me doesn't know my name

The signs I pass by, 'did Jesus set you free?'
He just helped me realize what kind of country this must be
And I made some friends in Arizona but I doubt they'd recognize my face
When the whisky leaves their veins and I'm just a memory they'd replace

Seattle seems so long ago and you're so far away
I've forgotten where my home is and I'm still counting down the days
It's raining back in London town, somewhere in my brain
Is a little piece of my tired mind, it'll never be the same

Somedays I don't feel like opening my eyes
Give me a makeshift backseat bed in this desert life
Nashville feels more like home to me and that's alright
Broadway's not the same in broad day light

Seattle seems so long ago and you're so far away
I've forgotten where my home is and I'm still counting down the days
It's raining back in London town, somewhere in my brain
Is a little piece of my tired mind, it'll never be the same

Give me just a few more hours
To gather up my thoughts into the corners of my mind, lift off again
'Cause I've been drinking way too much
That don't make a change, it's just a way for me to numb these lonely days

Seattle seems so long ago and you're so far away

On the smokey tin, it melts again and again.
On the booths of the round table, again and again.
Drug onto the street and onto the soaking steps, again and again.
Endless debris sifting through static lungs, lingering into every pore
Laced with a bitter face near the dawning of the high and madness of the undertow

With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

"The house was like a tomb.
I was hiding in my room.
As my brother made his way on down the hall.

I didn't want to say goodbye.
And I was trying to deny there was a war,
And that he got the call.

I watched him from my window
Walking down the drive.
Then I ran down the stairway
Through the front door and I cried

You come back you hear?
And I let him see my tears
I said I'll give you my rookie of DiMaggio.
I'll do anything you want,
Clean your room, or wash your car.
I'll do anything so long as you don't go.
But he said, this is what brothers are for.

Well I have my heroes,
But the one I love the most
Taught me how to hunt and swing a bat.
And I wrote him every night,
I said I miss our pillow fights,
But lately I just wonder where you're at.

Sometimes freedom makes it hard to live.
When it takes things from you that you don't want to give.

I said you come back you hear?
I miss you being near.
Laugh and fish down in the maple grove

I'll do anything you want.
There must be someone I can call,
And just maybe they would let you come back home.
But he wrote, this is what brothers are for.

I may never have to face the anger of those guns,
Or lie cold and wounded in my blood,
Or know the sacrifice and what it must of cost
For him to love me that much.

Well, it had been two years,
And I held back my tears
When I saw him in that wheel chair on the shore.

And as I ran and held him tight,
That's when he looked me in the eye
And said I'm sorry that you have to push me home.
And I said hey, this is what brothers are for.",5
"My Buddy Jake said hey its spring break so I picked him up in my truck 
We rode into town and there we found a cantina and sorority bus

Got the good life down and if you hang around we can get a little dust on that collar

Graduated the top of the school of hard knocks 
Pass the bar anytime I ain't thirsty
My country clubs exclusive to none but a fishing pole would come in handy

Get confused when you ask them to define it,
Cause its a miracle, 
It keeps the universe we see from ever dying,
And the stars from falling,
Though we can't see it
It must true 
And its the only thing I've found, to compare our love to

its invisible
You can't touch it
No matter where you go on earth you can't outrun it
It only exists to pull you in
Till your where your meant to be
Girl our love is a lot like gravity


Its a phenominal
How I can hunger for you're touch and need you're company
And its just beautiful,
How from across a crowded a room you're eyes will folow me till our bodies meet
And when I'm not with you I feel a tug inside my heart 
That's just never satisfied til I'm where you are

"I love the way you twirl your hair
Those overalls and flip flops you wear
The way you'd smile waiting in your drive
Hot Sunday afternoons

You didn't mind my rusty truck
Swinging by to pick you up
I missed your sweet face, it was six long days
Since I'd got to hang with you

And we'd throw two fly rods in the gun rack
Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
Sing to brown eyed girl
My guitar in the barn bridge shade

I'd number your freckles
And the times your fishing line tangled
And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
No, it ain't hard to remember those good ol' lazy days

And we'd stop by Ernie's General store
Got two maple walnut ice cream cones
Funny how they always seem to get on your nose
Yeah, when you'd ride with me

I'd cuss the moon tryin' to get you back
Ground all the gears while you just laughed
'Cause it was twelve o'clock, porch lights turned off
Yeah, and I was up the creek

And we'd throw two fly rods in the gun rack
Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
Sing to brown eyed girl
My guitar in the barn bridge shade, yeah

I'd number your freckles
And the times your fishing line tangled
And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
No, it ain't hard to remember those good ol' lazy days

Ain't it funny how we never could sell that old pick up of mine
Baby grab the keys, I'll get the jumper cables 'cause it's about time

And we threw two fly rods in the gun rack
Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
Sang to brown eyed girl
My guitar in the barn bridge shade, hey, yeah

I'd number your freckles
And the times your fishing line gets tangled
Love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
No, it ain't hard to remember, baby do you remember?
I think it's time we remembered those good ol' lazy days

"I'd say, I'm a lover, not a fighter
I never stare nobody down
'Til one night my girl
I could not find her
She never made it back from town

I found my Shannon crying in the woods
A wicked man held her down
So I stuck him deep and I buried him good
Not deep enough to fool the hounds

We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home

That train stopped in Tijuana
We built a shack beneath the sun
I make my Shannon margaritas
We watch our children laugh and run, run, run

Sometimes I miss my daddy
Sometimes I miss my mom
But I think they'd be real proud of me
To know the man that I've become

We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home

Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on, roll on

Shannon, why'd you run with me?
She said,
What was I supposed to do boy?
Just watch you leave?
You'd have broken my heart
You'd have haunted my dreams
Your love, boy, is all I need
Your love, boy, is all I'll ever need

We took shelter in a chapel

"It was a beautiful sunny morning, so we went for a drive,
Hiked up in the mountains, and we lost track of time.
A kissin' and a huggin', never saw the sun go down,
I said ""Baby we're lost"", and she proceeded to freak out,
So I said,

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
And that coyote howls, and the grizzly bear he growls.
I can get you through the night, oh yes I can,
I'm a mountain man.

I gave her a little hug, I said ""There's no need to cry"",
I used to be a beaver scout all I need is this Buck knife.
I can carve a hook, pull fish from a brook and I bang on with a gun,
Except tonight I don't really have one, and well, that's half the fun.
Awe you know I'm only kiddin' hun.

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
I know you're a city girl, but if you had to you could eat a squirrel.
Yeah I'd cook him up just right, you know I can.
I'm a mountain man.

We could pick berries in the moonlight,
'Cause I know which ones to eat.
How to recognize poison ivy,
Should you go lookin' for leaves.

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
I can bugle an elk, I can rattle a deer, I can grow you a big ol' bushy beard,
And live up here all year and never go back.
Yeah I'm a mountain man.
A man with a plan.
You're in good hands.
Yeah, I'm your mountain man.

"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!

Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",6

I watched you drift with the greatest of ease.
As the shadows pulled you further from view,
Its coming clear
I don't know you anymore.
I'm at the station waiting on a bus.
The moments move the last seconds left of us.
The wheels will ride and tear their way between.
A tear will slide. 
You don't love me anymore.
700 ocean water miles, 11 hours of land left to drive,
And 6 long months will separate 
Until I don't love you anymore.",6

Morning sun creep through your window pane
Cause love won't let me wait (not one more minute, baby)
The time is right
Turned down the lights
And take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night
In a wonderland
Now move a little closer to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait 
 (No , listen girl)
I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We will explode in ecstasy

"Her name was Lola, she was a showgirl 
With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind 

At the copa don't fall in love 
Don't fall in love",6

To break up our happy home
Don't get so excited

A little late at night

Own funny moods
I've got mine,
Woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you

"Autumn seems awful lonely here whenever we think of you
Last night the sky was purple and we wanted to share the view
The leaves on the trees are turning and the woods are all ablaze
The smell of the timber burning in the fireplace

Sunday we woke up early and we drove out to Tyson's farms
Gorging ourselves on all the cider and donuts we could fit under both our arms
Picking out penny candy in the country store
Until we collapsed on the porch with our bellies sore

So what's it like to be on your own
A roamin' vagabond
Away from home in search of some forgotten door
Is it half as good as it sounds

And tell me have you really found
The peace and calm we've all been lookin' for
Freckles still misses you, she always sleeps on the floor in your room
Ruth says she smells but you know it's just her very unique perfume

The tree in the back bore apples but they're green and full of worms
I guess we'll sit tight and wait until the cider turns
Everyone sends their love, they still don't really believe you're gone
Everyone's jealous of this crazy oddysey that you're on

Hoping this finds you happy and healthy and sane
Pray that your strength will ease you through the growing pains
So what's it like to be on your own
A roamin' vagabond

Away from home in search of some forgotten door
Is it half as good as it sounds

"There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control
Of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
 
But there, is a light
In the dark, and I feel its warmth
In my hands, and my heart
Why can't I hold on?
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
 
Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories, of a stolen place
Caught in the silence 
An echo lost in space
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
 
I watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, oh it always does
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away",5
"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",5
"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",6
"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind
The summer wind
The summer wind",5
"Deep in the dark jungles of Africa
There is a goddess the natives call Bet-I-Cha

Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha

It's a story that's told of a maid that never will fade
The tale of Bet-I-Cha

Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha
She's the song of delight in the night the natives will sing to you
Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha
The wise men say she's a spirit
Whose lover left long ago
But others say she's the music
Of lover's hearts all aglow
She may be moonlight so bright
Or soft winds sighin' at night
No matter where you may find her
She's one part close to your heart

Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha, Bet-I-Cha

And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Well I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling crackling caldron in some train yard

And she ran out to brush the snow away
It wouldn't die

Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart

I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago

It would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late
'Cause I would know

That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly
Late, late show

And Honey, I miss you
I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day

It was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And Honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I wasn't home
When she was there and all alone
The angels came

Now all I have is memories
Of Honey and I wake up nights
And call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up

A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down in the flower bed
That Honey loved

See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big

Seem to vanish in the air

I wonder where

Must I live ever after

"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always stayed 
Beneath my feet before
All at once am I
Several stories high,
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare
They don't bother me,
For there's no where else on earth
That I would rather be

Let the time go by,
I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live

The kind of passion you fashion cannot be explained
You I love
You're so appealing the feeling cannot be contained
And when I touch you
There's no denying the flying I do into space
You're just too much, you
The simple case is your face, is the face of faces

You I need
Not only merely I'm clearly a person bereft
Yes indeed
I'd draw the curtain for certain if you ever left
And if I stammer
Forgive my grammar
You got me winging, no wonder I'm singing
It's you I love

Can in April bring blossoms to the vine

Have a change of heart and be my valentine

Two silhouettes in the window that kissed by candle light

"I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart,
And as the door of love between us closes,
Tears will fall like pedals when we part.

I begged you to be different but you've always been untrue,
I'm tired of forgiving and there is nothing left to do,
So I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you broke my heart.

You've made our lovers lane a road of sorrow,
'Til at last we had to say goodbye,
You're leaving me to face each new tomorrow,
With a heart that you taught how to cry.

I know that I should hate you after all you've put me through,
But how can I be bitter when I'm still in love with you,
I'm sending you a big bouquet of roses,
One for every time you've broke my heart",5
"Candy kisses wrapped in paper
Mean more to you than any of mine
Candy kisses wrapped in paper
You'd rather have them any old time.

You don't mean it when you whisper
Those sweet love words in my ear
Candy kisses wrapped in paper
Mean more to you than mine do dear.

I built a castle out of dreams, dear
I thought that you were building, too
Now my castles all have fallen
And I am left alone and blue.

Once my heart was filled with gladness
Now there's sadness, only tears
Candy kisses, wrapped in paper
Mean more to you than mine do dear.",6

Just a hoping to see you again
Those laughing eyes and tender lips that used to thrill me
So I search every face in a crowd
No matter where that I go I keep on staring
For the face that belongs to you
Just looking for the favorite color you're always wearing
So I search every face in a crowd
I know I've said that I didn't need you
Every day every night oh how I failed
But I'll keep hoping someday I'm gonna find you
Some lucky minute some happy hour some lucky day
So I'll search every face until I'll find you
I didn't know that I'd miss you this way
I hope I'm not too late because I love you
So I search every face in a crowd
So I search every face in a crowd",6

How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe?

And if wanna have fun come along with me

"(I can't help it if I'm still in love with you)
Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
A picture from the past came slowly stealing

As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
And suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
(It's hard to know when others' lips will kiss you)

I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine,
I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine,
I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine,
I walk the line",7

You'd have a room full of roses
If I sent a rose of white for every time I cried all night

You'd be tearing half the roses just the way you tore my heart

Where we used to live

Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive

The house that we built was once filled with laughter
But I changed that laughter to tears
And now I live in a world without sunshine
Ohh, I wish you were here

Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive

Last night I dreamed that you came to our house
To take an old book from the shelf
If you'll open the shutters I'll tear down the boards
Cause I drove every nail by myself

Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive

One more time
Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive

I can hear the music of the song I sang to you

I remember that you care and then and there the sun breaks through
Just before I go to sleep
There's a rendezvous I keep
And the dreams I always meet help me forget we're far apart
I don't know exactly when dear
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear
And my darling 'til we do
You are always in my heart

And the dreams I always meet help me forget were far apart
I don't know exactly when dear
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear

And your warmth become desire
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are

Thrilling me again
Like that night in spain
Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""
Many skies have turned to gray
Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart
We made a promise and sealed it with a kiss
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""

Her heart was warm and gray
I heard the laughter of her heart in every street cafe
The last time I saw Paris
Her trees were dressed for spring
And lovers walked beneath those trees
And birds found songs to sing
I dodged the same old taxicabs
That I had dodged for years
The chorus of the squeaky horns
Was music to my ears
Oh the last time I saw Paris
Her heart was warm and gay
No matter how they changed her
I'll remember her ah that way
Dodged the same old taxicabs
That I had dodged for years

All they do is sing and dance
All they got is romance
What a tragedy

Every boulevard has lovers
Every lover's in a trance
The poor people of Paris
I feel sorry for the French

Every guy has got a wench
Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French

The poor people of Paris
Milk or water from a sink
Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think
The poor people of Paris

Sister Madam Pierre
Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly

Pierre was there to bid her farewell
But he brought his new girl Claire
The poor people of Paris
So don't go to Paris France

Not unless you like to dance
Not unless you want romance
Like those poor inhabitants of Paris

In the meantime, I got to hurry back there
I think I forgot something...",5

That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play
And now that I wander
My thoughts ever stray

South of the border down Mexico way
Ah, she was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face
It was fiesta we were so gay

South of the border down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered manana
Never dreamed that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered manana

For tomorrow never came
South of the border I jumped backed one day
There in a veil of white by the candle light knelt to pray
Ah, the mission bells told me that I must not stay
South of the border down Mexico way

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
And on a very cold and wintery night
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight

And when the summer came
They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
They didn't know a girl could look so cute in a bikini suit

Oh, how they sing of the good, good old days
Long, long ago, long, long ago
They couldn't swing in the good, good old days
Long long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
(But they still talk of the good, good old days)
And on a very cold and wintery night
(Long, long ago, long, long ago)
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight

So when people say to me, ""Nothing's like it used to be""
(They say it was better in so many ways)
I don't believe that it's so
(Long, long ago, long, long ago)
They didn't have so much to brag about
Long, long ago, long, long ago, long, long ago",6
"Up in the mornin' out on the job, work like the devil for my pay

But roll around heaven all day

Good Lawd above, can't you know I'm pinin'

Send down that cloud with a silver linin'

I look at her and I say to myself
There's my lover
Just imagine she comes running to me
For love

I feel so proud I could shout to the crowd
There's my lover
But the crowd mustn't know
For I mustn't show my love

Those are the lips that kiss me
Those are the arms that hold me
Those loving hands caress me
Oh, but the Fates have blessed me

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover
Be it right, be it wrong
I'll always belong to her

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover
Be it right, be it wrong
I'll always belong to her

"Here we are out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are in the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone from the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father did not like you at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well, here we are just above the Seine
Foggy little fella,drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father did not like you at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?

And too much in love to say goodnight

You're better better than a dream
What you are is better far better than a dream

But now I see you you're out of this world you're out of this sphere you're out of that outer space
Better better than a dream
What is real is more ideal than a dream
To see and hear you to be so near you is better better than a dream

Can this be a dream
Can I still be asleep on the couch there
Can this girl be really here
She seems to know by sheer intuition how I landed in this condition
Or does she know me the way I think the way that I drink the fact that I slept all year
But it's not a dream 'cause look I've got some words on the paper
Steady boy don't faint or scream
Don't ask who sent you this angel it's better better than a dream",7

I tried to get away from the flame but the flame tossed my heart
And I'm captured yes I'm captured
I'm enraptured by your charms
I can't hold out I've been sold out
By the thrills I found locked in your arms

The moment that our eyes met I realized
Another moment more and I'd be hypnotized
I tried to turn away from your eyes but your eyes held me fast
And I'm captured yes I'm captured
There is nothing I can do
I can't back track there's no track back
I am yours heaven open it's doors
And as I wandered through

Captured by you

Under the wonderful skies
For a city bred feller, a field of yeller
Is quite a delightful surprise

Oh, you don't have to pay for a day in the country
It's old mother nature who buys
And while we keep going, the breezes are blowing
The cigarette smoke from our eyes

You'll hear beautiful melodies played by an old water mill
And a little red barn is spinning a yarn to the daffodils up on the hill
Oh, there's nothing as gay as a day in the country
Far from the maddening throng
A hobo hobnobbing with bluebird and robin
We warble a merry old song
And go rolly, oh rolly, oh rolly, oh rolly, oh rolling along

And cute little guy who's casting a fly at a trout leaping out of a brook

My what lovely scenery cupid's own machinery
Made to trap a nervous chap like me

Let's be friendly let's be discreet
Must I fight the feeling that I'm falling
Should we accidentally kiss I'd give up the fight
And we could move more than just good friends tonight

"The look
As she pass she flashed that come-hither look
The look
That was meant for me and for me alone

The look
Would be out of place in a children's book
The look
That could chip a piece off a heart of stone

Consider a bit this interesting little tableau
A look I could read but where would it lead me to
But mischievous elf I labeled myself diablo
And did just exactly what she was sure I'd do
Now at her beck and call
She ties me to the strings of her Spanish shawl
That isn't all
One foot out the door and she gives me the look

I say goodbye now she puts her foot down
I'm flying high now that's when I'm put down
I want to die now she puts her foot down
Freezes me with the look

Someday if she sashays by you and looks your way
I'd say you'll do well if you overlook the look
The look

He did magical things
He said he could turn any heart
That was sad in to one that sings
I told the magician
What had happened to me
My sweetheart and I had a quarrel
And now I was blue as could be

Waved his wand in the air
I looked and to my surprise
My sweetheart was there
We kissed in the moonlight
Stars were twinkling above
I suddenly knew this was no magic trick
Just the magic of love

The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my lonely tears instead
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'

And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on

But when I see you passin' by
My heart breaks down
And cries a million tears

You broke my heart and set me free
But you forgot your memory
And it keeps right on a-hurtin'
Since you're gone

Yes, it keeps right on a-hurtin' every minute of every day

On the common folk like me
Makin' bets to what degree of fool we are

You see yourself above us
Standin' in the mud gazin' at the stars

The common cold, the heartburn and the heartache
Put our pants on just the same

'Cause I can tread water, babe

While you got your raisin, girl
And your diamond-studded world
I got pulled up on the hungry side o' town

I cut my teeth on bacon rind
There ain't no hide as tough as mine
But it might be fun awhile to be your clown

So, get your whip and do your thing
And I'll run around the ring
Ride my white horse, wear my armor too

Ah, but I don't easy blister, babe
I'll be your court jester, babe
Don't think you won't pay fiddler too

Aah, I put your hand in mine
It was a shockin' time to find
The water hot, current strong, deep and wet

You had me strugglin' for a time
A draggin' on your line
But never fear, this fish will never swim

While you're playin' with my mind
I'll be payin' with your money, honey
As long as your account can stand the drain

I'll fan the flame and make it hotter
'Cause I think I can walk on water
As long as you can make it rain

Aww, I'll hang around awhile
Study your style
Come out a whole lot wiser man indeed

'Cause last time anyone as grand
As you appeared and looked around
Found the grandest star up in the East

Hey, but I don't see no halo
Just a little girl with a lot of gold
Want one more trinket for her golden scene

Ah, but you got a hot one hangin', kid
Don't let him say you never did
You best be my guest, make it rain

Aah, make it rain

Make it rain

Hair that's lost some of its beauty
By too many hours in the sun

Eyes that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in my life
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife

Everyday has been uphill
We climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I wanna stop

Lips that are weary but tender
With love that strengthens my life
Saint in a dress made of gingham
My woman, my woman, my wife

Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control in my mind and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

When she reaches that river
Lord, you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
'Cause she's been through hell here on earth

Lord, give her my share of Heaven
If I've earned any here in this life
'Cause God, I believe she deserves it

[Chorus]
I live for tomorrow
For I know what's in store,
I can be sure that tomorrow
Will be sweeter than before.

I'll do all that's in my power
Just to keep the old ways new,
Every minute every hour
I'll spend loving you.

Every minute every hour
I'll spend loving you",7
"Here comes more tears to cry
Here comes more heartaches by
Here comes my baby back again

Here comes more misery
Here comes old memories
Here comes my baby back again

My arms are open wide
To let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby back again

He's sorry once again
Once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby back again

Here comes my baby back again
My arms are open wide
To let more hurt inside
Here comes my baby back again

He's sorry once again
Once more I'll understand
Here comes my baby back again
Here comes my baby back again",6
"I want some red roses for a blue lady
Mister Florist, take my order please
We had a silly quarrel the other day
I hope these pretty flowers, chase her blues away

Wrap up some red roses for a blue lady
Send them to the sweetest gal in town
And if they do the trick, I'll hurry back to pick
Your best white orchid for her wedding gown

I want some red roses for a blue lady

Let it always be senza fine
There's no end to our love
Our hopes, our dreams, our sighs
No end at all, no sad goodbyes
No fears, no tears, no love that dies
It's senza fine
Senza fine
Let it always be senza fine
Never-ending

The sunlit days, the moonlit nights
The sea, the sand, the starry heights
Are yours and mine forever more
All we are and all we know
Is love and love alone, so
We'll go floating far above
In never-ending timeless love

"Gal is like a racehorse, I play her to win
But if I should lose her, another may come in
Love can be like heaven, love can be a joke
But it's worth a gamble so, hey, I go for broke

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three

Who's got the action?
Just say it on the line
I'll bet you ten to one
You'll be mine

Now once I had a Philly, I ain't seen her since
Some can't go the distance, they're only good in sprints
Sweethearts stay together, when it's fair and warm
But comes stormy weather, they don't run to form

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three

Who's got the action?
Just say it on the line
I'll bet you ten to one
You'll be mine

They put on a long shot, I play either way
All I need is a winner and this could be the day
When I win my parlay, I'll be set for life
I'll take all that money and go find me a wife

Who's got the action?
Who'll take a chance on love?
Who's got a kiss for me?
Give me one and you'll get back three

Who's got the action?
Just say it on the line
I'll bet you ten to one, I'll bet you ten to one
I'll bet you ten to one, you'll be mine",6
"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling
It's almost like being in love",7
"Every little breeze is sighin' of love undyin' at sundown
Every little bird is restin' and feather nestin' at sundown
Each little rosebud is sleepin' while shadows are creepin'

In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven
When night is fallin' and love is callin' me home

Every little breeze is sighin' of love undyin' at sundown
Every little bird is restin' and feather nestin' at sundown

"Everybody sings the blues sometimes
And everybody knows the tune
And everybody knows the way I'm feelin'
'Cause everybody's had the blues

Love, hate, or want and wait till misery fills your mind
But everybody knows the way I'm fellin'
'Cause everybody's had the blues, yes sir

Even though my mind tells me I should
Then you make me think you really love me
Then all my thoughts of leaving do no good

You got me heart over mind, worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know, but I just can't let you go
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change
'Cause my heart won't let my love for you change

Now friends tell me they see you out with others
In my heart I try hard to forget
You come home and tell me you still love me
I still hope there's some chance for us yet

You got me heart over mind, worried all the time
Knowing you will always be the same
You'll keep hurting me I know, but I just can't let you go

"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",5

And it's a good day for movin' along,
Yes, it's a good day, how could anything go wrong,
A good day from mornin' till night.

Yes, it's a good day for shinin' your shoes,
And it's a good day for losin' the blues,
Ev'rything to gain and nothin' to lose,
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.

I said to the sun, ""good mornin', sun.
Rise and shine, today""
You know you've gotta get goin'
If you're gonna make a showin'
And you know you've got the right of way

Cause it's a good day for payin' your bills,
And it's a good day for curin' your ills,
So take a deep breath and throw away your pills,
Cause it's a good day from mornin' till night.",8

Are all really true
When in my heart I know
The magic is my love for you

You sign the song begins
You speak and I hear violins, it's magic
The stars, desert the skies
And rush to nestle in your eyes, it's magic

Without a golden wand or mystic charms
Fantastic things begin when I am in your arms

When we walk hand in hand
The world becomes a wonderland, it's magic
How else can I explain those rainbows
When there ain't no rain, it's magic

Why do I tell me myself
These things that happen are all really true
When in my heart
I know the magic is my love for you

Magic, magic, magic, magic",7

I've had this lonesome hurtin' feeling all night long
I didn't know I loved her and now she's gone

I always like to hear those country singers sing
And the way they play those guitars boy they sure do make 'em ring
But when they sing the words I can never sing along
I didn't believe things happen that way I thought our love was here to stay
'Till yesterday she walked away and now they're hittin' home

I think that I just wrote

I wrote some words about the good times that we had
And then some lines about losin' my mind or missin' you so bad
And I did leave out a thing about the way you done me wrong
And I sang my song to the saddest note that anybody ever wrote

"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",6
"Think about me whenever you're lonely
Think about me whenever you're blue
Think about me when you have heartaches
Think about me thinking bout you
In the evening when the sun sets and blue shadows fall
All through the starry night till another day calls
I'll be a waitin' for eternity waitin' for you to return to me
(Think about me) when you have heartaches
(Think about me) thinking bout you
(Think about me)",5
"Turn the world around the other way
Back it up and stop on yesterday
Back to before that silly fight
And give me a chance to make things right

I said some things I didn't mean to
Say things that I am sorry for today
Down on my knees I beg you
Please to turn the world around the other way

I never really wanted us to break up
And I'm sorry for each teardrop that you've cried
We need to give our hearts a chance to make up
And darling will you stand in by my side

We'll turn the world around the other way
Back to where it started yesterday
Just take my hand, together
We can turn the world around the other way

Turn the world around the other way
Back it up and stop on yesterday
Just take my hand, together
We can turn the world around the other way

Yes, turn the world around the other way",4
"When it's twilight on the trail and I jump along
The world is like a dream and the ripple of the stream is my song
When it's twilight on the trail and I rest once more
My ceiling is the sky and the grass on which I lie is my floor

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means
Guess, I was born, born that way

When it's twilight on the trail and my voice is still
Please plant this heart of mine
Underneath that lonesome pine on the hill

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means
Guess, I was born that way

When it's twilight on the trail and my voice is still
Please, plant this heart of mine
Underneath that lonesome pine on the hill",7
"There's something strange in the old corral
There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral,
Seems there is someone at my side

[Chorus] 
Empty saddles in the old corral,
Where do ya ride tonight?
Are ya roundin' up the dogies,
The strays of long ago,
Are ya on the trail of buffalo?
Empty saddles in the old corral,
Where do ya ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border,
Or a band of Navajo
Are ya headin' for the Alamo?
Empty guns covered with rust
Where do ya talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do ya walk tonight?
Empty saddles in the old corral,
My tears would be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely,
As ya carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corral

There is no smoke, still the fires burn,
There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return
Softly to vanish through the bars

"You've got to give a little, take a little
And let your poor heart break a little

That's the glory of love
You've got to laugh a little, cry a little
Until the clouds roll by a little
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all its charms
And when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little, lose a little
Yes, and always have the blues a little
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love
That's the story of,
That's the glory of love.",5

"To be loved is a thrilling sensation as thrilling as can be
Though it happens in every nation they greet if differently
Every mademoiselle with pasoolala, every Englishman talks to his pater
Every spittin' Venetian goes tra la la and the Irish say Mother McCree
But when I look at you and I thrill like I do there is only one thing I can say

Oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy! oh boy!
Oh boy what a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy, a joy
To know that you love me by heaven above me
I never expected to pick you off the vine

(The others will try and try and try and try and try
To give you the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye, the eye)
But when they approach you I'll keep them in line
By telling them oh boy oh boy oh boy you're mine

Certain characters hi-diddle-diddle when cupid comes along
Some mechanics shift gears in the middle and drummers kick the gong
Every cowboy I know hollers yipee
Every clown in the circus goes oopla
Every sailor in port hollers anchors aweigh
And an Indian gives you a ugg!
But when you hold me tight like you're doing tonight
There's only one thing I can say

Rambling and scrambling heading to town
Hustling and bustling buzzing around
Happily waiting at the station

Look at the train the number seven-o-nine
Huffing and puffing arriving on time
Who do you think's about to arrive
The band they call the Dixieland Five

They're gonna play that Muskrat Ramble tune
The way you never ever heard it played
Get ready for the big parade
All together now one and two come on and join the happy throng

Feel the beat of that rambling scrambling muskrat song
Come on and ramble along
Look at them shuffling shuffling down
Well look at the band parading all over town

Look at the happiness going around
Everybody's up and celebrating
Look at the drummer entertaining the gang
Clinging and clanging with a bing and a bang

Changing the town from dead to alive
The band they call the Dixieland Five
You're gonna hear them play that Dixieland
You better get your reservation plan

In person on a one night stand
All together now come on folks come on a join that happy throng
Feel the beat of that shuffling scuffling muskrat song
Come on and ramble along",6

When you're ramblin' days are through?

Why I want you heaven knows

Who can cling to a ramblin' rose?

"Because I still get a thrill thinking of you
And I still feel your lips kissing me too
Although our love affair wasn't to be
I wonder if you care care about me
I still remember that night under the moon
I recall that it all ended too soon
I can't believe you're gone memories linger on
'cause I still get a thrill thinking of you

"Sue wants a barbecue,
Sam wants to boil a ham,
Grace votes for Bouillabaisse stew.
Jake wants a weeny bake,
Steak and a layer cake,
He'll get a tummy ache too.
We'll rent a tent or tepee.
Let the town crier cry.
And if it's RSVP
This is what I'll reply

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Better save a chair
When the party's gettin' a glow on
And singin' fills the air
In the shank of the night
When the doin's are right
You can tell 'em I'll be there

""Let's have a jubilee""
""When?"" said the prairie hen, ""Soon?""
""Shore"" said the dinosaur.
""Where?"" said the grizzly bear,
""Under the light of the moon?""
""How `bout ya, brother jackass?""
Ev'ryone gaily cried,
""You comin' to the fracas?""
Over his specs he sighed

In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Tell 'em I'll be there
In the cool, cool, cool of the evening
Slickum on my hair.
When the party's gettin' a glow on
And singin' fills the air
If I ain't in the clink,
And there's sumpin' to drink,
You can tell 'em I'll be there",6

And you'll sing ""Vita bella""
Hearts will play tippy-tippy-tay, tippy-tippy-tay
Like a gay tarantella

When the stars make you drool just like a pasta fazool
That's amore
When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet
You're in love
When you walk in a dream but you know you're not dreaming signore
Scuzza me, but you see, back in old Napoli
That's amore

I'll never be a fool again you really crushed my pride

I made a mess of things I guess but now I'll recognize
The next young thing that tries to say its a love-light in her eye
The love light that you spoke about was only just a flame
'Cause every tome you meet a man it lights right up again

And on a very cold and wintery night
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight

And when the summer came
They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
They didn't know a girl could look so cute

In a bikini suit
Oh how they sing of the good, good old days

So very nice (i'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry (beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (listen to the fireplace roar)

So really I'd better scurry (beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (no cabs to be had out there)

I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (i'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say, no, no, no sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)

I really can't stay (oh baby don't hold out)
But baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go (but baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (but baby, it's cold outside)

Your welcome has been(how lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (look out the window at this dawn)

My sister will be suspicious (gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (waves upon the tropical shore)

My maiden aunts mind is vicious (gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)

I've gotta get home(but baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say lend me a coat(it's up to your knees out there)

You've really been grand (i thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (how can you do this thing to me?)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (if you got pnuemonia and died)

And that tears are only rain to make love grow

He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",6

On the pane and we're alone

There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain

And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

Italians love to sip a cup of cappuccino
And listen to the man who plays the mandolino
You offer him a cigarette a glass of wine
That's how he's paid to serenade your lady fair

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

He seems like such a happy man, the man who plays the mandolino
He sings a song of sweet romance for all the lovers as they dance
But all he's holding in his arms is just a little mandolino
He has no woman of his own so every night he walks alone

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

(And while he's strumming songs of love the man who plays the mandolino)
(His eyes are always looking for a senorina to adore)
He drinks a toast to his true love each time he lifts a glass of vino
And so until that lucky day he looks for her along the way

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy
The man who plays the mandolino

It's a melody!
Full of the laughter
Of children out after the rain!
You'll hear a tuneful story 
Ringin' thru ya!
Love and glory!
Hallelujah!
And now that my troubles are gone
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin'
Cause I feel a song comin' on!
 
I feel a song comin' on
And I'm warning ya
It's a victorious
Happy and glorious new strain!
I feel a song comin' on
It's a melody!
Full of the laughter
Of children out after the rain!
You'll hear a tuneful story 
Ringin' thru ya!
Love and glory!
Hallelujah!
And now that my troubles are gone
Let those heavenly drums go on drummin'

"If our lips should meet Innamorata
Kiss me, kiss me sweet Innamorata
Hold me close and say you're mine
With a love as warm as wine

I'm at heaven's door Innamorata
Want you more and more Innamorata
You're a symphony, the very beautiful sonanta, my Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love

You're a symphony, the very beautiful sonanta, my Innamorata
Say that you're my sweetheart, my one and only sweetheart
Say that you're my sweetheart, my love",8

Oh my dear I'm so lonely
Hurry back, hurry back
Oh my love hurry back I'm yours

Return to me
For my heart wants you only
Hurry home, hurry home
Won't you please hurry home to my heart

My darling, if I hurt you I'm sorry
Forgive me and please say you are mine

Return to me
Please come back bella mia
Hurry back, hurry home to my arms
To my lips and my heart

Retorna me
Cara mia ti amo
Solo tu, solo tu, solo tu, solo tu
Mio cuore",5
"[Background chorus]
(Peanut do bop do bop)
(Peanut do bop do bop)

In Cuba each merry maid wakes up with this serenade
Peanuts (they're nice and hot)
Peanuts (he sells a lot)
Peanuts
If you haven't got bananas don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
you hear him sing his plaintive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today)
If you're looking for a moral to this song
50 million monkeys can't be wrong
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(In Cuba his smiling face is welcome most anyplace)
(Peanuts they hear him cry)
(Peanuts they all reply)
(If you're looking for an early morning treat)
(Get some double jointed peanuts good to eat)
For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)
The merry twinkle in his eye
He's got a way that makes you buy
(Each morning) that whistle blows
(Are you more than I sell)
If an apple keeps the doctor from your door
Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more
(Peanuts) we'll meet again
This street again
We'll eat again
You Peanut Man, that peanut man's gone
(Peanut, peanut, peanut)",6
"Your sweet expression the smile you gave me
The way you looked when we met
It's easy to remember so hard to forget
I hear you whisper I always love you
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember but oh so hard to forget
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight
I'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling stealing through the night
Each little moment is clear before me
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight
I'd rather dream than have that lonely old feeling stealing through the night
Each little moment is clear before me
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember and so hard to forget",5
"Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm a girl I wish I knew
On an evning in Roma

Though there's grining and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and one is one too few
On an evening in Roma

Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evening in Roma

Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma
Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evening in Roma

"See it in your smile I hear it in your sigh
That we have found a feeling higher than high
My own, my only, my all

Kindled by your kiss the warmth of your embrace
The luster of a love-light lighting your face
My own, my only, my all

Knock on wood as well I should
For all that you're making of me
Never thought you'd love me
But you do you do

And when I look up at the stars
And ask them all what's new
They join me in the answer Darling it's you
My own, my only, my all

Knock on wood as well I should
For all that you're making of me
Never thought you'd love me
But you do you do

And when I look up at the stars
And ask them all what's new
They join me in the answer Darling it's you

My own, my only, my all",6
"I'm praying for rain in California
So the grapes can grow and they can make more wine
And I'm sitting in a honky in Chicago
With a broken heart and a woman on my mind

I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
And they asked who's the fool in the corner crying
I say, a little ole wine drinker me

I came here last week from down in Nashville
Cause my baby left for Florida on a train
I thought I'd get a job and just forget her
But in Chicago, the broken heart is still the same

I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
When they ask, who's the fool in the corner crying
I say, a little ole wine drinker me
I say, a little ole wine drinker me",4
"I'm sinking like a resting stone.
With demons in my head.
I feel you from my skin to bone, 
With darkness in the air.

Chasing down your silhouettes, 
I find there's nothing left.
Facing down a lonely road, 
Into the pure unknown.  
But I'll keep coming back!

You can steel my mind, 
Twist it for a while,
But you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track, but I'll keep coming back.

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track, 
But I'll keep coming,
I'll keep coming back!

Streets of heaven never had a name.
I found my own way there.
I know I'm bound to lose my way again, 
Cause love and war is never fair.

Facing down a lonely road,
Into the pure unknown.
But I'll keep coming back!

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track,
But I'll keep coming back!

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack,
Throw me way off track,

Take my mind, 
Take my mind to rest!

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack,
Throw me way off track,
But I'll keep coming back!

On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
Wait, wait along

I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love and duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his'n
I'm not afraid of death but oh
What will I do if you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
Although you're grievin', don't think of leavin'
Now that I need you by my side

Wait along, wait along

"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.
I know you've forsaken me,
Till the shadows fall.
But then once again
I can dream,
I've the right
To be close to you
All through the night.",6

For always I hold your hand
For always be your man, be your man
Be your man, be your man
Be your man, be your man

All is nothing without you, without you
Without you, without you

"Found myself just the other day
In the backyard of a friends place
Thinking about you
Thinking of the crowd you're in,
What you're up to, where you've been,
Just thinking

You know the clothes that you wear and the color in your hair
Shouldn't change you
Now you tell me why is it so,
You're bigger than Mighty Joe

At least you think so

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

Threw my smoke down on the ground
Turned my head and I heard the sound that reminded me
Of the days so young and sweet
Always so much fun to me,

At least I thought so

Now you think you're so damn fine,
You could rule the world,
No not mine,
I don't think so

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

You know the scene that you're in and the people that you've been with
Just get to me
But you think I'm not as cool
As you are so beautiful,
Who you foolin'?

Well I'm here to tell you babe the game you're in is just a game, so damn pretentious

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

You think you're so beautiful, so beautiful",6
"See your face just the other day 
Takes me back to the other place
When I feel it's not too far away
And I just want to hold your hand and walk with you on another day

I want you to sit on my lap 
And do the sweet things 
That we used to

At the place just the other day
And I ordered a drink the tonics on its way
When I feel it's not too far away
And I just want to hold your hand and walk with you on another day

I want you to sit on my lap 
And do the sweet things 
That we used to
I love you 
So come on girl 
Let's do the sweet things 
That we used to",6

If you wanna know your name
Be your friends
And if you ever want to pay

All of this place
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And if you wanna hide yourself
Be the one
It's hard to know how far you go

All of this place 
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And if you wanna hide yourself
Be the one
It's hard to know how far you go

All of this place 
Is all about to fall
Right down on you
If you change what you say

And you know what you know
And you see what you bend
Can't believe it's insane
Come on and be what you mean",4
"First time that I saw your face
I was blown away without a trace
I felt so alone on a busy street
When you passed me by
I felt my feet melt away
Melt away

I pray to God that I could meet
Somebody like the girl that I'd just seen
Someone that can stop me dead
Someone that will spin round, in my head, all day
In my head, all day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you

That night I saw her again
Was the first time I touched her hand
She made me feel so warm
We talked all night, til the dawn came our way
Til the dawn came our way

But the timing was all wrong
When I met the one, I should've known
Instead I walked away
Leaving behind my destiny on that day
My destiny on that day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you

But I still see her face
In my mind, it's the only place
And we will meet again
And I will touch your hand again, on that day
Your hand again, on that day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you",7

Master, I feel I am much too bright

"Sometimes I watch my life
And it slowly goes from black then into white
I know if you watch the time
Leaves you standing for a moment in life

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

So I wait to seize the day
With a clouded mind
And a hell of a load to pay
I find that if you know your way
You'll get out of this mess

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

I know there comes a time
To believe in yourself
And grow in confidence
Stop hiding behind the door
Like everyone else
Just get out and do your best

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

I know that I'll find my soul",5
"And so it goes another lonely day
You're savin' time but you're miles away
Your flowers drowning in some bitter tea
For seeing lost opportunity

Find your mirror go and look inside
And see the talent you always hide
Don't go kid yourself, well not today
Satisfaction's not far away

Hold on now your exit's here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Your coffee's warm but your milk is sour
Life is short but your here to flower
Dream yourself along another day
Never miss opportunity

Don't be scared of what you cannot see
Your only fear is possibility
Never wonder what the hell went wrong
Your second chance may never come along

Hold on now your exits here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Hold on now your exits here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",5

I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give

If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",6

In your eyes I could feel the friction

Turn a communist into sharing bombs

My girl in a uniform
I throw stones from the balcony
Throwing rocks at the embassy
I'm gonna give my body and soul
My girl in a uniform

Sweet taste of a guilty pleasure
Tied down, I can feel depression
A scorning voice on the coldest defeat
Oh, you knock me off my feet
Turn me inside out

You're my girl in a uniform
My girl in a uniform
I throw stones from the balcony
Throwing rocks at the embassy
I'm gonna give my body and soul
My girl in a uniform

For you, I lose control 
For you, I lose control 

Too much to (?) it's pretty sore
Too out of reach in to waging war
Go down like an atrocity
For a girl in a uniform
A burst of telepathy
For a girl in a uniform
For you, I lose control

Throwing rocks at the embassy

I drop science on the instrumental
I take seven ill drums put `em in a line
And add seven more snares to make it combine
It`ll take seven more horns before I start to rhyme
Now that twenty-one beats made up at the same time
I was bound ta shine haters get left behind
Ain`t no time for them, stamp my name on rap
Perhaps you hear da words from pay next sequel
Part two something for tha people
I`m still number one

Now I appear return ten years the pioneer
Deliver action thrillers that explode in ya ear
Compensate for all the ups and downs in my career
Stop the small talk my focus remains clear
Should have won a Nobel prize for thoughts and ideas
Critically acclaimed while some of y`all cats in tha game for fame
Fame lives in my name Pete Rock it`s simple and plain
Check it simply stressing it soon to start chin checking kids
God protected, so I`m selected to orchestrate the next great
And create, contemplate the world`s fate P.R. the heavyweight
Put these thoughts in ya mind while we on the topic
You can tell I`m still on it by the way I rock it
Full swing introduce the ninety-eight product
Niggaz talk the gossip but they ain`t got shit
I`m number one

This goes out to deejays and emcees
Unlock real hip-hop, Rock holds the key
Magnificent ya style is irrelevant
I`ll flip the bass and erase any trace of sample evidence
Trust a few men within this circle of thieves
Single out the enemy with ease
Earned every stripe on my sleeve
The five star general keep it moving ya rap needs improvement
So here`s a lesson ta learn, lyrics under fire burn third degree
And my steez is making hot tracks for G`s
World famous, salute my capabilities with 21 guns and ammunition
The SP runs 91 rounds precision on target with this rap bullet
First string team in position
The medal of honor hanging from my neck swinging
I`m still number one",5

Stop the nonsense it's 98 time to set the record straight

Separate movers and shakers from those that hesitate

"From the basics and warm, weather places
Dedicated to the brothers that never made it
Cut short, they prime read life between the lines
Photographed by rhymes yo it's hard times
All across the nation cold points of frustration
Created hot joints of illustration
Concentrate while stakes are high falling victim to the lie
Keep a sharp eye there's a steady supply of hate in the air
To them cats who stare the ice grill with the glare
But everything is fair in the city the sheisty the shiftee
I'n the epitomee of a raw deal now carry a sword and shield
And walk with a forcefield for real I overcame the odds
And got the hell out of dodge soul survivor of the war
And master in charge

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live nigga keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

I watched the whole world from the side of my eye
I seen a lot of cats die and evil men lie
On the road to riches in pursuit of my wishes
It's a close call between friends and snitches
On the low the game brought moments of pain
Strong emotions plus the hardships of fame
No need to live forever just keep some type of cheddar
A buttersoft leather to rock in cold weather
Times are mad real official like the seal
Try to understand what I feel
My word to the wise it's where ya heart lies
Keep your biz straight far from family ties
I'm the illest soldier that represents the culture
Dignified bywords like fresh, fly and ultra
Champion heroics and passionate poets
Flashback to the future let it self focus

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But beautiful black sisters keep risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

Still in basement for four years arranging
Lyrics and beats my first lote engagement
It's outstanding the boy wonder's back in the world
By popular demanding on top commanding
My own destiny go ahead try to test me
I been living right so expect no less g
Got positive reaction and affirmative action
The soul survivor guaranteed satisfaction

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live people keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

And if I die before I wake I pray go God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die before I wake I pray to God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving

Went on to create and perfect the unexpected

Savagely attack this, clash with, accurate aim
Spark the flame, burn this inside the vein
Ride tracks like the soul train, hold ya brain
In the state of shock, make em drop hits of cocaine
I bang with the big boys, those who hold name
Amateurs get hung with they own gold chains
I swing blades, best bring grenades against
A tru master, way beyond your freshman attempts
Spit rounds on the floor, evidence of the war
It's on til the death til we settle the score
You can never measure, to the standard, of the most

Ghetto summer jam's got the streets blocked off
Plots to knock me off get stopped short
Armed with my thoughts, move the world with an unknown force

 As a ten then again she was probably an eight 
 Her ass was kinda phat so she moved me yo 
 When I scoped out her mental was straight said let's roll 
 Stared this shorty everynight and everyday 
 On the rebound around left right and hey 
 I'm a critical brother when it comes down to broads 
 But this wop here is like the Grammy Awards 
 Had style and grace and class a lot of taste 
 On a slow dance we romance around my place 
 Like a king from queens is how she made me feel 
 And if I did dirt it was locked and sealed 
 No doubt was all about me and my love thing 
 If the phone called Paul I was lettin it ring 
 Absolutely, she looped me the hook was good 
 Niggaz buggin on me buggin in my neighbor hood 
 Yeah boss, but on course is my game plan and 
 Shorty wop keep me chillin with the name brand 
 Kicks and whips, going all out chicks, flicks and tours

 You sewer rat better be careful where you step ya foot at 
 You might get snapped, caught in the trap 
 Sneekin bout a cheese stack so sewer that and ease back 
 You fleece that it's G Rap many cats want to be that 
 Better believe that iced up, find me where it's below zero degrees at

 Both of us together we bomb makers bottles of Dom breakers 
 Many mansions on farm acres pushin porches with four doors 
 Diamonds with no flaws with the pretty mamas 
 on beaches of Bahama shores 
 Pinky ring is like a stone age without the dinosaurs 
 Comin from me G Rap yo, truly yours",5
"Introducing c.l. then face defeats
Then I remind you of third street when it was sweet
See'd us move on and grow to another plateau with me and ....
Havin that dough
In the last days when critical times are left
To deal with my grand daddy's endeavors
Whut corrected my errors the first shot came in 91
E.p. done my struggle
To label this untouchable foundation due in 92 top ten review
Respect new when that flew they reminisce over you
Had marie too, sporting my nike's at the door
Paper saw the main ingredient l.p. in 94
Now it's me the bold coppin toys for dolo
At ease he'd rather die at his feet than live on his knees
Don't mistake the forest for trees
Off course why try and climb a mountain
A baby walk across in tha military mindset place ya bet
Ya fumbled all those chicks with the bucks off safety
Skirt chasin what they rate me in this whole rap affair
Butwhen it really comes down to it who cares
Like the tortiosse and the hare ya know the race I run
But ya losin all the nights, let the rabbit get the gun
Number one wit a bullet and pit named black
It's the best that ever did it on a pete rock track

Aye yo two cool cats who reclaim the name
Pete rock and c.l. smooth in this here rap game
But the good news is that there is a crew
Not 5 not 4 not 3 da two

In tha beginning let it be like the record spinning
As a child I stack 45's in a pile blow the dust off
Put it on before I can walk
Play static on my pop dukes automatic
I knew I wasn't average music in my bloodstream
My pops watch his son live his dream
Now as time flew the original classy rock crew
Shine through on streets and avenues
The next chapter you read it mc shan said it
Got ta give the man behind wheels credit
Yes yes y'all bls and marley marl
The rap attack put my talents on the map
Now it's pete rock for days in tha basement
As I amaze watch me blow in 98 ways
I specialize in rap dj and produce wit more
Hot tracks then carlos dejesus

Chorus 2x

What it look like ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still riding with c.d.'s and leather roll fives and better
For all that's folded in ya pocket how long it take
To reup and clock it, drop and make a profit
And lay my position with you that we know what to do
And what not to do here's my crew now you get yours to bare witness
It's nothing personal it's business
That's my word which is my bond, behind writing ta step back
And watch it all tighten stop this fighting each other
God knowledge ya wis that ya know who the enemy is furthermore
Don't hide it divide it then x ya squares
To keep them other cats folded like beach chairs
Got an eye on that street aristocrat
Let c.l. show ya where the strengths at
Turn it up right here or just call the cop
'cause we on it like this to tha last stop
The next humprhev bogart mastering art
Like a jeweler wit a diamond cutter, take'em apart
Don't start whut ya can't finish
When ya bubble wit skills that never diminish
Ya best team against mine is a light scrimmage
So play like popeye and eat spinach

He was an industry type, influenced by magazines and snipes 
Rocked Adidas but he had no stripes 
I could tell in high school that he had no fights 
Hold dick better than he hold mics, he spiked his punchlines 
with current events, called for backup 
like one time when he heard it was Sense

Whether the hip-hop type, country rapper, or big wheel

Or make enough loot so I can buy my own provillian
Throw a fat party and invite everybody
And play all the old school hits like Lodi Dodi
Connections like OPEC while ya hung up like a Kojak
I'm real like a ruby while ya fake like a pinchback
That's imitation gold if you didn't know
My rhymes flow as my vocab' grows and grows
I freak it for the basslines always walkin on ya frontline
Catch me while I'm boomin' in ya alkine
Yo I'm out like a shot from a tec
You need to think twice just to earn respect, so

[Chorus: Pete Rock](5X)
""Sucka MC's please think twice
You don't know what you doin'
Think about that"" 	-> Special Ed - Think About It

[Verse 2: Pete Rock]
Aiiyo, as I come through for '95 with the flav'
So amazin' the Boy Wonder's blazin'
Respect the mic check, one, two
Cause I display the funk material as I stand imperial
To others, gotta lay low, undercover
Cats flow to the hands for the crowd in the stands
So here I am, plus I rock to please the public
They want it, word son, they want it
To hear the Soul Brother disperse words of wisdom
When InI comin' direct on the set
So represent, a lot of rap niggaz came to win
But the style played out when they chose a different route
Whatever as I stay true to the game
Word to the troubled T-Roy you know my name
Keep an eye on the stakes as I watch my back
Think Twice before you try to grab the mic and react

[Chorus](5X)
[Verse 3: Rob-O]
Yo beg your pardon...
Whn I put one to the head now the funk shit startin'
Fine soul I headline for my public get mine
Yeah my rap subjects packed with potential
Plus the versatile elements to crush ya scent
I get down so cheer the mental
Rhyme-pro I'm Rob-O the super spectacular brown skin nigga from Africa
Blowin' up so it's impossible to get
With the highlight and fly right and the niggaz on my dick
Split when it's through, gotta skip with the Guinness Crew
Give a shout out to my Uptown Crew, word up
From New York, New York the Big Apple
To the four square miles Uptown armed for battle
Your niggaz is nice but my advice is you can't suffice
So Think Twice, uhh

[Chorus](repeated till fade)",5
"Ain't no second time to appreciate
Ain't no second time to appreciate
Ain't no second time to appreciate
Ain't no second time to appreciate
Ain't no second time to appreciate

First of all, you better count your blessings
When you got C.L. now you got bad boy, your connections
In return, while we live and we learn then you know what it is
To only build a bigger future for the kids

In peace, in war, let's take it to the floor
Every time we take two steps the crowd takes four
Lay the heat, how I come to the street, how I cut through the beef
Let me handle that, that's why you make me chief

It's packed, what they want in this here
Can we weather the storm, six minutes, C.L. Smooth you're on
All the anger and the fear was in the dressing room prayer
That we came out to light it up and put it in the air

That's real, so holler back at ya boy, step aside Leroy
To all my ladies, who want tickets, enjoy
'Cause I spit it and you gotta get with it and you'll never forget it
Yes, I want the best out, count 'em all

Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us

Ain't no second time to appreciate
Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
When it all goes down, baby, all we got is us

You tell 'em this is history in the making, avoiding disasters
This run is for the green jacket, I fit the masters
My crew havin' business, save, put it in through my office
The security is tight and the secretary is gorgeous

That's official, me and Pete in the lab, that's what they want
Pushin' that real hip hop up to the front
The game's been good to me, preserved my youth
Not only did it capture my goals and told me the truth

Look out my hustle, made a living, paid and driven
See why they tour around the world came to save us from prison
It's great, I rather love than hate
You think it fell out the sky, I'm here to tell you, why believe in faith

Hard work payin' of and them wishes comin' true
Bolt open and you out to lunch and left us two
Now you know we can't let that pass to get that cash
We in the big numbers, count 'em all

Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us

Ain't no second time to appreciate
Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
When it all goes down, baby, all we got is us

Why my uncle doc left me everything when he died
And when pop passed, two weeks later I cried
And when great grandma left it all went crazy now
All I had left was grandma Pam, that's my baby

Can't talk bad about me, she tell 'em why we need to give her
All those roses while she could smell 'em
I live this moment used to stay how we was
How my mother came to her in a dream and told her

Corey will come out of this deep dark depression, stand by me
Give my insight a resurrection and heal me
And feel me, what you got is to love, got a thing
This little woman who brought back the thug, let's grind

Ghetto's of the mind while I'm in my prime
I left, so y'all can catch up, I'm ahead of my time
Your legacy and that lazy boy say it ain't fear
My next generation triple my digits, add 'em up like

Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us

Ain't no second time to appreciate
Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
When it all goes down, baby, all we got is us",5

Word to my cousin, the truth and no lie
Me and my dawg was in his brand new Land, puffin' on lye
Tameka came by, glossy-eyed as she cried
Lil' Jay got sprayed with a chrome four-five

That's my motherfuckin' man, get in the Land
Head to the rest, grab vests, switch whips to the Caravan
I heard an ambulance right up the block
Plus more shots, the shit's gettin' hot, pull up and park

By the back, pass the gat, hit the lights and lay back
Hold up, now roll up, yo where them niggaz at?
I know one of them cats from the projects with Jay
The first nigga move, I'ma pull this gun, spray

No delay, we stay night to fuckin' dawn
It's on, my head spinnin', feelin' my cheeks get warm
Tears drip as I stepped out the whip
Slipped a clip, had to get hit, uh-uh that's that bullshit

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets

Yo, I can't believe my man since 3rd grade got sprayed
Bullet laced as he laid, chokin' up blood with no aid
Made money for the purpose of his daughter
Victim of an unmerciful slaughter, explain harder

Or don't bother, I'ma heat yo' ass like lava
Identified was that tinted gray Chevy Impala
Fleein' the scene, as the back tires screamed
Now for them my man [Incomprehensible], ruined his whole dream

Of playin' ball pro, bitch that's how it go
You let me know, I'll hit your whole fuckin' team with the metal
Mental struggle got my hand under the bubble
Tryin' to blow steam and leave the scene blood puddles

Snakes, whattup nigga? These niggaz ain't explainin'
Well, fuck it then, it's time for some gestratin'
Hit him in the worthless shell he came in
Murder is a sin, but it's worse him dyin' on revenge and I ain't havin' it

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

I ain't havin' it, reached in the bubble and grabbed it
Automatic cocked back and squeezed through his Polo fabric
Nigga duckin' and runnin', irrationally gunnin'
Thinkin' to myself, do I gotta hit someone

Then I heard shots from a back route
Fired back out, got shot, dropped and blacked out
Put in a clap out, didn't map out or act out the plans
Now I'm consciously layin' while bullets is sprayin' the Caravan

We can't lose, I hear shotguns then 22's
Left arm booze, or blood soaked through my Adidas shoes
Heavy breathin', a lot of bleedin'
Bitches screamin', put over on my good shoulder, started squeezin'

Out the back window, she gave the wrong info
Suddenly crashed into a Pinto
Hopped out, flew through the back yard, word to God
It's on and I felt the gat slip through my palm

Kept runnin', hopped the fence, hopin' that I didn't leave prints
Spotted a black Ac' parked with dark tints
Broke the passenger's side, hotwired the wide and slide
Another unsolved homicide

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

"It's Talib Kweli in the place to be Brooklyn
Most definitely yaknowhatImsayin', Mount Vernon
And Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth, the brothers who brought ya
Escapism, Return Of The Mecca, Straighten It Out, The Creators
Yeah, right about now, we about to make history

The track make you nod like smack through the needle
Niggaz don't sell crack is they evil
America's build on the backs of my people
Cats say they packin' the heat but they actin' like Chino
'Cause when it's time to bounce it back they fall back in the field though

I went from crashin' the beat in the passenger seat
Drivin' like many straight trees don't even mix coke with the Henney
Flow with so many styles ladies open all night like Denis
24 hours party people soakin' in the Remy and Cris'

The video is directed by Benny and Chris
Treat a pager like a website with plenty of hits
I tell 'em this, you gotta be at least a dime for a piece of mind
I deal with porters and keys just like the leachious mind

I like mature girls just now reachin' they prime
Know how to conversate to the man and don't eat no swine
If you ready to roll than we can rock shit
My niggaz so cold we hot

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

Psychedelic we sell it and niggaz jealous fellows
Go get your hate up get your weight up, I'm tellin' you straight up
You need to turn that frown upside down you use less muscles
The smile is easier than it sound, it's true

Lookin' all crooked, I be tellin' these dudes
They should Straighten It Out on a Pete Rock track like C.L. Smooth
See we livin' in the Matrix way before the movie
Kids fiend before the camera screaming, just shoot me

Now they scream a million miles away from the sun
But you still feel the heat when we packed us the way of the gun
Like tape digs, raise kids to escape the slave ships
Instead they wanna pump weights not the state

Better exercise take from work the rest get left inside
And whips chicks and kicks money we specialize
I be the respirator so hip hop is kept alive
So many niggaz buggin' me, I need a fuckin' pesticide

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

You put light back to life 'cause these rappers ain't actin' right
Thinkin' they cut like Mack the knife, rap the fight
Battle right through the afterlife
'Cause when you die make you look way past the life

And high sight, I drop the type of rhyme to give the blind sight
Sparkle a shine bright like lemon lime, sprite up in the limelight
Yeah as we still at the track, you feel it when the chorus tack
You deal it twist a cap back with a skillet, official would kill it

'This is fake the way we sill it as the great Pete Rock and Kweli
Got Pete to make you chicks knees knock to Pete Rock my life
It's the soundtrack other niggaz sound wack
Like white kids tryin' to sound black

I spit on mics wet up the essence where L drowned at
This Guerrilla Monsoon Rap first comb rap
Soon rap come through a crossroads and all these lost souls
Will stand out with stress signals like morse code

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

"The joy of children laughing
These are the makings

Another sure shot, another banger
'Soul Survivor, Part II' for me and you, let's get it

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

Yo, master of ceremony, controlled territory
It's Tay, the mad journalist always trying to write a better story
And laying tracks 'cause it's better for me
Calm but predatory, sun niggaz even when the weathers stormy

My crew is down to do whatever for me
Got my back like scoliosis when I'm handling mine
Find it hard, though to manage my time
Between the gaming and rhymes, without severing my family ties

But yo, that's what happens when the world is loving you
Groupies skipping pills with ill plans of fucking you
A high price for fame that's non-refundable
All in the hopes of one day coming out with a double you

I know it sound crazy, right?
Even though it's hard sometimes I still got to stay in the mix
It's Pete Rock on the snare drums and laying the kicks
And on the real I wouldn't trade it for shit
Let's get it up right now, come on

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

I got the magna rocks still heating up the spot
P.R. and L.B. got that shit for blocks
Hip hop when we walk, hip hop when we talk
You can hear it our slang and see the New York

We bought back 94 when the music was pure
Everybody made jams 93' and before
Hearing 'Illmatic' first on the trip to the store
Lost my mind but I knew it was
That we had to work toward forward

On we move now, my life is the roof
Putting the pen to the pad when it's time to spread news
Daily digesting some more wack shit
Mother-fuckers better stick to the script
We need you back Jay

y'all dudes know now we not for play
You want it funky, come around my way
(For Real)
You can choose to rock or choose to roll
I chose Pete 'cause he got the soul
Yeah, let's get it going y'all

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

King cobra rapper crew
Ill Capitan, never roll a foot solider
We push over, you pushovers
Lil' pussies need to douche over

Mass and Gills, Scott hare will make em' gush over
Pussy and poetry, two things that's good for ya
We rock hard just like the hood told us
That fake shit I never could show you
We ought to keep it true and authentic

In they videos trying to walk wit it
L.B. put the street talk in it
From right now till the day that we forfeit it
Just making sure that y'all get it in time to put my heart in it
Little Brother crushing all gimmicks, like what

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you

You're beautiful, the way you wear that, share that
Have many ladies, but nothing can compare to that smile
That style that drives men wild
That ring could have Big Daddy walkin' down the isle
Proper you a show stopper, girl endure dropper
I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower
And I'm right there to wipe down your body
Spread that scented lotion all around your curves
Anything you want, all she deserves
Baby calm your nerves make this work
Only thing in life you fear is being hurt
Here to protect thought otherwise
I'm here to correct you can trust me

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
You and I now that's a hot couple
When it's off in the same club
Now you askin' for nothing but trouble
Watch you jumpin' at the Red Labels
Got my woman and her girlfriends dancin' on the tables
Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggaz cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' the steel
Read my will my boys get it all no gimmicks
But I'm here to let you know my jump off is off limits
Life and love get made for a thug
Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

Tot game is crazy diamonds off the lettle
Travel through these ghettos drop to top
Let 'em see what I'm workin' with came to win
How the don keeps the fun to blow in the wind
World war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not
But no-one can match this chemistry we got
Why they all fall, you C.L.'s wive
Cause all we got is eachother a bond for life",6

High as a kite, rollin' dutch after dutch
Honey leavin' the scene with me
Now she wanna get a room, but at one nineteen with me
Lowrider jeans, fanny pokin' out the pants
Do the snake, the wop and the uh-oh dance, ohh!

You can find me uptown, uptown, low in cement be's
Rollin up in the club like the {?}
I don't know why you hate me, I'm tryin' to date me

And just how thirsty all these hoes is
Wide door knockers with the rings in they noses

Half moon part and a two-wheel moped
Quarter water, Jimmy Chu's for my honey

It's the, Boy Wonder at the cruise control
Are you really ready for some super dynamite SOUL
Relax, let me spark the L
And leave smoke on the track as the tires peel
When I rock what's real niggaz appeal to that

And stay elusive, a lot of y'all fake-ass niggaz
Wish you can do this, passion from the heart makes you true in this

Make haste on the freeway like the Greyhound
And avoid these clowns and let real niggaz know

Large nigga seem scary, out in the hood
Shootin tic-tac-toe in your Burberry
For generations, a cold verse killer's been chillin out
Waitin in the cut, spillin out
Hot shit, yeah they feelin me now, cause I linked with Pete
The best at it since Nas and ""Illmatic""
Respect is automatic, got it, well hold it
A lot of MC's will need it to pay they rent, sewed it
And eventually fold it (uh-huh) check my resume
I'm like H&R Block when I rock
Y'all niggaz get the greatest return, plus a 3rd degree burn
When I earn airtime like H. Stern
Kardinal's like a 20 carat diamond
Up in the rough dust, New York check the shinin
I'm intertwinin, line for line combinin
With Mr. Rock rhymin, flowin on time and
Stop your whinin, y'all couldn't let go
Since I flowed over the remix of ""Grindin'""

[Chorus: Kardinal]
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in the USA, they say ""yes DJ""
When Pete's in the blend they say ""my nigga come again""
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in J.A. they say ""yes DJ""
When I'm in the see-A-N they say ""my nigga come again""

[Kardinal]
Yeah what makes the best rapper, ice on the wrist?
Ice on the chain? Ice in the bucket with the Crist'?
Ice grill, iced down, ice inside my frown
Ice start sparklin on the spaghetti strap gown (HU!)
Kardinal, nickname No Gimmicks
Still the nigga to get up in it, rip the place down
Rock a wife beater, show off my belly when I'm ready
The type to drive around on bootleg Pirellis
MC's gettin stuck like clubgoers in Chi-Town
Rip any prick from Brixton to my town
The T Dot, yeah you know me
Bringin back the bad bwoy style, yeah ya owe me
Gun finger in da air, shootin blanks
Thinkin bout the day I can live next to Phil Banks
'Til then, my circle niggaz straight out the hood
Don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good

[Chorus]
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in J.A. they say ""yes DJ""
When I'm in Brixton they say ""my nigga come again""

[Kardinal]
Yo yo, protect your +Head & Shoulders+ when the Kardinal bust
Boy I take care of two in one shot like +Pert Plus+
Buck buck! Niggaz get dumb live on acetate
Massacre masses of MC's on mixtapes (yup)
Street cats get taken out with street raps
Live from the streets where peeps meet to see a weak nigga see defeat
Why'know, take a week to look back
And reflect on how you can't spit when Kardinal speak
Unique like o-ccasional crackheads
Monster talk to settin off a gourmet verse like rice pilaf
(Fuck off!) I'm great
Save the petty black trash talkin for Ricky Lake

[Chorus]
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in the USA, they say ""yes DJ""
When I'm in the see-A-N they say ""my nigga come again""
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in J.A. they say ""yes DJ""
When Pete's in the blend they say ""my nigga come again""
We good",7
"Uh! Man I never did no shit like this before man
I just keep hearin' this fuckin' voice in my head man
It's like it's good vs. evil really man
On one side I hear somethin', 
And on the other side I hear some other shit

It feel like fire (fire) Shut up in your bones
What's this devilish shit you on?
(It's like the body of a vampire, you nocturnal, you don't tire)
Only move around in the dark
The light burns your skin you have no heart
(They call me Mr. Sinister, arch angel, Lucifer)
I'm a son to the anarchy
I'll show you the way if you follow me
(And I come in many shapes, the message I spread to you, is hate!)
And I'm a catch you a homicide
They killed your cousin in your face and you 'gon' let it slide?!
(But I got plans for ya, do this for me I'll show ya how my child adore ya)

[Chorus] 
I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

Now do it just how we planned
(Get right up on him and blam!)
You can do it from the front or behind
(But I wanna see a nigga lose his mind)
And don't worry 'bout the police
(That's just one less nigga on the streets)
And now this block is yours
(His girl is yours!) The world is yours!
(I'm just a voice in ya head)
A figment of your imagination instead
(And I spoke to the best of them, got a long list
And I ain't get to the rest of them)
(And not yet, how much you wanna bet,
I make you go postal shootout your projects)
(Or you whole school, you a young fool, 
And don't nobody love you like I do)

I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!)
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

My child! I have a place you could rest
And take the stress off your chest
Just sell me your soul and we go
To the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
I make you rich (Celebrity overnight)
Fuck bitches (Sell drugs) Live your life
(Don't need to worry 'bout nothin'!)
Keep on gunnin', keep on hustlin'
(Plus I know how to make it pop)
Oh you a hot boy? I know you like it hot
(So give a nigga up, go 'head, wear a wire set a nigga up)
(And all your care about is Benji's)
Triflin' you don't feed the hood, you stingy!
(And it's just a dream and it don't seem right)
(You ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light?)

I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

Back to, Pete Rock and Smif-n-wessun lyrics
These lyrics are not available for printing.",6
"It's time to dip dive dip, you might break a hip
To the sound that's legit, I've come to make a hit
I usually bust scratches with my brother, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide you're going on a ride
I know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
Guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire
Beats are rough and rugged, Pete Rock is the creator
Now I'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada
Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up, I save this subject for later
But, it's time to catch wreck with the creator

I'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there's a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold cause I'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
Fortified with soul cause that's what I give 'em
Honeys form a line form a line cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
Far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this, don't even consider it
Skins when I want 'em, but, only when I need 'em
To set the record straight, I'll be damned if eat 'em
Call me Pete Rock, I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow, because you know I'm good to go
As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this

Now, I'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec to get some wreck
Never filled with anger, a good body banger
If you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can't see this
My word is beneficial, Pete Rock is the issue
And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch (Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse (No question)
Either one, I can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around, I'll show you what I mean
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

It's time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator

C.L. Smooth, get busy",6
"Some live the good life loungin' by the pool 
Catching a suntan and everything's cool 
Male or female  you want to be set 
In the big mansion drinking Moet 

You read the Wall Street Journal 
Later for the comic 
Far from dumb because you practice logic 
You lived poor in the ghetto 

Never had the money easily 
But you found the remedy 
So you  your girl  and your kids could have a better opportunity 
And teach them all about unity 

Cultivating in the brains the words of Allah the master 
And they go far 
But, you still go visit your old stomping ground 
Indeed to help another that's down 

A tough situation cuts like a knife 
In search of the good life 

From the church, the home, on down to the prison 
People want to know how is he and she living 
Does he work? 
Do you wonder if his life will bloom? 

Is the girl going to have the kid anytime soon? 
How's the mother? 
Do they ever go visit the brother? 
What about the dad? 

I heard he drinks undercover 
Some are still shooting up, another on crack 
Just the other day trooper got sent back 
What type of life do you lead? 

Tell me 
'Cause you can be anything you want to be 
Some will strive for the good life in any case 
The mind is a terrible thing to waste 

On drugs, violence, and hatred of another color 
Hear me now, brother 
All around the world the husband and wife 
Work night and day in search of the good life 

The G double O-D L-I-F-E 
Living in luxury 
Care free 
Period 

No time to waste 
We catch ours all day 
We work instead of play 
I B-U-I-L-D inside me 

Knowledge and quickly you vacate the city 
From a paranoid mental delusion 
Plain and simple 
I won't cause confusion 

Yo, that's your fault 
Stop the somersault 
'Cause I put the bad like mo to a halt 
My destiny I define is heavenly 

So, Fort Knox, open sesame 
Light shines and the birds keep singing 
As I still cling to my positive upbringing 
With the need to succeed, right? 

On a natural high 
The good life",5
"[Pete Rock]
Uhh
Ahh yeah
What we talkin bout? Talkin bout the skinz
Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

[CL Smooth]
I hear it callin never stallin hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it`s loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca want to bang bang
Beggin a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thang
CL, kickin flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin on the wins, I`m about to hit the skinz

[Pete Rock]
Talkin bout the skinz
The skinz
That`s right, talkin bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin bout an everyday thing
C`mon

[Grand Puba]
Ha ha ha!
Hey, hey
Yeah...

Nowadays I`m on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)`ll kick you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziplock
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it`s hard like Charles Bronson
It`s kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won`t hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who`s the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she`ll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won`t be the Post
After that you know the flavor I`m ghost!

[Pete Rock]
That`s right, be out..
Hit it off.. on the skinz

[Cl Smooth]
C`mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they`re forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
but never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won`t curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I`m with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

[Pete Rock]
Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin like thunder
til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I`m out

[CL Smooth]
Like the Isley`s, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it`s OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

[Pete Rock]
How I hit the skinz, uhh
It`s fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don`t try to show
Because I`m, the accurate man
Everybody knows it
Peace to all stealers
of the Mount Vernon
Young poets and players
New Rochelle, the Bronx...",6
"Here comes the hurricane, C.L. same name
Cut by the grain when I land upon the plain
Jah knew the Hebrew, a Papa Duke need you
But none of the fam who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime rate, words coagulate
Generate the mind's state, never can deflate
Nigger, you jigaboo, it doesn't have to be you
Funny like a cartoon, Pepe Le Pew
Pimp are the lyrical, g-string the individual
But the metaphysical isn't spriritual
Straight from the heart I frame the art
Tune up my class, real fast, very smart
Dictate the technique, wait a minute, I speak
Loved by my son and a kiss on the cheek
Stutter-step the concept, blueprint, or pro
Steady as we go so act like you know

I stand by the rabbi, sail in Shanghai
Always had an alibi even if I lie
Crucial, never neutral, bare the fruitful
Past time, another rhyme, skedaddle, Yankee Doodle
Light skin in lovely gyp, just for the honey dip
Here to make a megahit fit
Don't install the pipe dream, renaissance regime
When you run ragged I pick up the steam
Chart on the record book, what Corey Love took the hook
Here's a new book to civilize a crook
Purest of the pedigree, feed 'em a line
C.L., no Jezebel, can never sleep well
Thick like a dred, at the Club Med
The Mecca Don said, a fish out of water is dead
Pete Rock, the soul brother, cruise on a flow
Swing low and yell ""Geronimo!"", act like you know

C.L. can play like Nike, come on just do it
Pacify the Gemini, soul into it
Beat to my feet is a lock like concrete
Hard for the street, decipher never incomplete
A clean editorial, rather historical
Affordable, recordable, nifty like a portable
Mecca is the syndrome, when I come back home
Boogie on a baritone, listen on a phone
Libra, the achiever, toke a reefer
C.L. the girl pleaser, like Ebanezer
So here is the good sign, I incline
Titties with the bitties when I wine and dine
Worn like corduroy, comes the bad boy
But just like Anita Pita, I bring ya joy
""Agoobilonians"" with your knowledge
And take as said so, flow and act like you know",6
"""You know, nowadays it, seems like there's a lot of..
Bad things going on and, I guess a lot of it,

Fellow brothers and sisters""

South Africa, what does it mean?
To burst the scene, or conquer like a philistene
War or peace, which one do you prefer?
Pass me my M-16 for the disaster
A reason for the treason in a jet black season
For peace, justice, and freedom
For the Original Man, architect of the Motherland
Kings to Queens, is the Asiatic Black plan
Pre-Adam-ite, first to see the light
Way before Adam and Eve took flight
Bless the seed of Abraham, I came to jam
Protest the teachings of another man
Uncle Tom stay loyal so they boil
I'm the alchemist with the twist from the true soil
My blood brother Adolpho on the side of me
My vision ain't blurry, so don't even lie to me
The rebirth the revival of our culture survival
To elevate, the black man is vital
You gotta realize now what we're facing

Here's the situation from a darker view
Night and day, salt and pepper in the earthly stew
But the salt think it taste better, straight up superior
Therefore, the flavor of the pepper's inferior
Incorrect though, giving some heartburn
Level of a devil better wait your turn
And here is one recollection of imperfection
No one should be judged by complexion
Lie-braries; broken down as lies buried
To force their beliefs to pilgrims all hurried
Television; tell-a-lie-vision
A schism; negative realism
Four-hundred-and-thirty-five years til weak
Mental deaf dumb and blindness put us to sleep
Out of the dark comes light so the first can't be
So Armaggedeon comes like a thief in the night
Rednecks flex to my context but in the projects
Some won't survive the next confrontation
And I'm aware of segregation
Pump your black fist for the anger in the nation

Some walk slow, cause the water's not shallow
Let my people go, you little Pharoah
Listen how they word it, be observant
Then house negro; today, civil servant
I want to drop the bomb but remain calm
Strong like the power of the Fruits of Islam
Black is beautiful, hot like fire
Guess how many times they thought they killed the Messiah
Malcolm X, Dr. King, let's sing
All around the world let freedom ring
Reality is real, so how do you feel
From being kings on a throne to picking cotton in a field?
Your slavery is lack of identity
One of the things that's not making you a friend of me
What's your cause - aim, rationale?
Cause I made up my mind, I never scrape or bow
But teach my own, the sound of black unity
Together we can rise and now's the opportunity
The Tuskegee Experiment, indeed it was big
When they used the black man as a guinea pig
Animalism, pumped on a lower level
But can only be the works of the devil
And I'm telling you now the frustration
The future's facing from the anger in the nation

"Here come's the rugged one, plus the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark lover, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
Cuz I can do wonders under cover

I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause slick like blue nile

Plus the way that I flow blood clot

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah
So funky, like a street junky
Like I said before, here we go, c'mon
For Pete's sake I break and update, wait, I radiate
The dub played to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission
The P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K., resume
With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Off spring the lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round
The cut don't flow that I touch is not a preemie
And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie
I don't think so, peace, I gotta go
And shake like an earthquake, cousin, for Pete's sake

Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow blood clot
Yo, my style's cock-diesel and I can do the hustle
Niggas know the time, I don't have to flex a muscle
I'm not the type to fake it, I wouldn't try to take it
Tie your girl to the back of my Jeep butt-naked
Slide her monkey ass down the hill
So if you don't want beef, money, chill for Pete's sake

To my man

Music please

The Mecca's sweet like nectar, maybe cause you need it
There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I suplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black press can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a pena
Perfect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renagade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla
C.L. Smooth and Pete Rock
Could break and penetrate, piece of cake, cousin, for Pete's sake

To my man, for Pete's Sake, c'mon",6
"Above the level of a mezzanine, healthy as Ovaltine
The dominant gene clean, I mean go, the light's green
The protege could play like chess to quest the best
Confess, never poor as Bangladesh
I get busy like a boxer, operate like a Doctor
Seal like a locker, pop like Orville Redenbacher
Buy the tape, LP, CD
All me, and Petey, to cater to the needy
Like a Prayer for Madonna but A Different World for Jasmine
CL is well a physical attraction
Let me make myself perfectly clear:
While I'm there, I make a peer a positive pap smear
Really I do, once I light the barbeque
Thread the loose ends, see my friends are the crew
The fright night King of New York like Frank White
If it ain't rough it ain't right man listen

If it ain't rough enough, to mingle in the stuff
To scar and scuff and make you cuckoo like a cocoa puff;
It ain't right so I smash the satellite
Check the farenheight, before I take flight
Unique as Mozambique, here to freak Sheik
The skills that won't leak, and never antique
Warm like a oven you're lovin the style I'm druggin
Alleyway muggin, heavyweight sluggin
No fibs I kick the ad libs and rock it in the cribs
Break your ribs like a toothpick cause you were never slick
? you lacked back when I first started
CL's the one who got the Red Sea parted
My conversation qualification is a doozy
The rude Rudy wreckin write you off as a floozy
I shoot for the moon, but even if I miss
I'm among the stars, to put a bullethole in Mars

In my frame of mind I design the best-seller
For rougher cats can Rockafeller you're Penn and Teller
Steady with the convo, rought like Brillo
Let your head hit the bed and knock the feathers out your pillow
The master intelligent, with the black testament
Found it relevant, and mailed it to the President
But overall I get papes for my labor
With the physical manifestation of a saviour
You wanna test this, but I slay anyway
Cause your rhymes are old, with more wrinkles than a shar pei
Mecca Don upon the streets of Babylon
Pass the baton to respond like Farrakhan
Hard like Shaft with the staff for the Backdraft
A blazin aftermath, so hon make a path
If you don't trust him, bust him
But if you don't have a weapon, then kid keep steppin
The main idea in here for the hemisphere
CL's here to get wreck for the year
A large man's appetite, blowin like dynamite
If it ain't rough it ain't right, COME ON!",6
"Prepare yourself to catch a verse from the big purse 
Rotate the megahertz  where you heard it first 
The perpendicular  said none similar 
Quadruple any figure  quick on the trigger 

Helter skelter  wig out by the goodfella 
Not Lou Pinella 'cause I'm black and mo' betta 
Bust a phenomenum  we come to get busy 
Deep in roots  but my name ain't Kizzie 

Many many march 'cause I'm heavy on the starch 
Never tell a farce when I scale on a arch 
Jammin' on the radio, brothers say, ""way to go"" 
Shape it like Play-Do, soprano at the Chateau 

My theory periodically flows a odyssey 
Bigger than modern technology 
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat 
It's like that... 

C.L. is the attribute you salute 
'Cause I gotta make loot, can't afford to be cute 
Enter the equilibrium in a medium 
Breaking your cranium with no ultimatum 

Drop a psalm like a bomb, never land in your palm 
And now I'm so cool and calm 
Pure unadulterated, premeditated 
Lyrical form, Pete Rock is the storm 

Sophistication I kick to a nation 
I rare compilation I call recreation 
The prognosis, so mackadocious 
Straight up ferocious for those who can focus 

Large like the Beatles, ask all my peoples 
Never make movies, so don't talk sequels 
So, hon, save the chit-chat when I kick a format fat (it's fat) 
It's like that... 

I'm all sold out, no doubt, without a question 
The blessing your guests in a suprucated session 
Anyway your honor, heresay the melee 
Is here for the payday, so A to the K 

Or should I say Deda, original baby par 
Smooth like a reservoir, the funky Shang-Ri-La 
No shame in my game, I'm set to entertain 
And if it wasn't for the fame, skinz would never know my name 

So back off a tad bit, that's a bad habit 
'Cause I write the raw...for sure 
Now I'm a flip a style and get crazy versatile 
Never fragile 'cause I'm flowin' like the Nile 

Swing a jewel or a gem, notice how I say them 
With my approach, smoke a rhyme to a roach 
A four-season lover, light-skinned and bigger 
But what I deliver come before the cotton picker 

So here's to another hit, perfectly legitimate 
When I hit the skinz, guaranteed to keep the candle lit 
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat 
It's like that...",6
"Lots of lovin' lots of lovin' 

A sweet serenade  sip lemonade 
As we laid inside the shade 
My heart was captured when you possessed it 
Caressed and blessed it  even suggested 
You love me and I love 
And together it would just be us two 
I would protect ya  in your moment of fear 
Relax lover come here 
And let's create this heavenly fantasy 
When you lay next to me 
I need you, and only you, to give me more 
Tender love right down to the core 
If you could read what's on my mind 
You will find my feelings are genuine 
Day after day, you're the one I'm thinking of 
With lots of love 

Lots of lovin', lots of lovin', the heat 

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
Make love everyday, okay, produce 
I ride through the tunnel of love, share a milkshake 
Carve our name in a tree by the lake 
Look in your eyes 'cause I miss you much 
The way you say, ""I love you, C.L."" and your gentle touch 
We reminisce with a french kiss 
And out of all the girls, you're the first on my list 
The only one now, and truly for life 
My fiance and future wife 
Now you realize, you're the one I'm thinking of 
With lots of love 

Lots of lovin', lots of lovin', the heat 

You want to be treated like a queen, stroked like a kitten 
Every night you're the mitten I'm fittin' 
Tease your lips with the tip of my tongue 
And there's no doubt about it, lady, I'm strung 
On your love, looks, and affection 
You qualify, top choice selection 
Woman of a darker breed 
Mmm, cutie, you got what I need 
Pour the champagne and toast the glass 
Taste, but don't drink too fast 
'Cause we got many nights to cuddle by the fireplace 
You blush when I touch your face 
Now you realize you're the one I'm thinking of 
With lots of love 

Lots of lovin', lots of lovin', the heat 

Allah made you beautiful and youthful 
So I feel giving you love is suitable 
A walk by the beach, watch the sunset 
Love is strong, like when we first met 
Wake up in the morning, see your face 
And I feel no one can take your place 
Ever, so don't even think about it 
I need your love and I can't live without it 
Baby, you're the one I'm thinking of 
From C.L. Smooth, with lots of love 

Lots of lovin', lots of lovin', the heat",7
"""He's a SWEET soul brother""

Soul Brother #1, here I come on the new tip
Nestle coated right, cause I'm rich thick and chocolate
Plug up any mic I'll bet you Pete Rock'll spark it
Hons always ask what's the bulge in my pocket
I tell em, ""Papes,"" I rock them top to bottom
Never hesitate to say (""Mmm I got them"")
Oppressed on the Hillside, over on the chill-side
Of town, so let's get down
Funky is the word describe this Brother on a Soul mission
Hookin rugged joints, more Soul than the Soul Kitchen
CL doesn't scratch, so I won't leave you itchin
White people even say, ""Pete Rock is bitchin""
Harder than the hardest, odder than the oddest
I guess that's just because I'm smarter than the smartest
So back up, clear the path hon cause here I come
Soul Brother #1

I hit harder than a kick, quick to scoop a chick
When it comes to skinz, Pete Rock got it thick
I'm not your average, everyday, one-two to the beat
And don't stop, bust the shit I drop
New style for the 90's Pete Rock's a trendsetter
I'd just be lyin if I said there's someone better
You can ask Greta, Greta with the red Jetta
Honey did me lovely and I'm glad that I met her
I come style after style, sucker MC's try to swallow
But them seem to say my style's too hard to follow
So just raise your hand and give praise to the #1
Soul Brother, who keeps the crowd in a daze
Pete Rock, and CL Smooth and if it ain't our groove
Then you might not move
Remember, cause there's no need to worry none
Yo, Soul Brother #1

Soul Brother #1

Nuff respect to my man Grand Puba
Nuff respect to my man BizMarkie
Nuff respect to my man CL Smooth
Nuff respect to EPMD
I'm like high octane, with everything to gain
Those who try to step to this can catch pain
I keep a mag in the trunk of my Jag, in case some punk fag
Wants to catch one bad
Soul Brother #1, and I didn't come to riff
The finesse I posess will make the hardest unstiff
I'm full of motivation handle any situation
Hon said I'm so smooth they should call me lubrication
Mr. Splendor, a good back bender
Honies always say, Pete love me tender
Call on Pete Rock, CL Smooth if you want the job done
Soul Brother #1",6
"Uh, yeah. Uh-huh
We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon

Walk the fine, short line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Show-lin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one to five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

Tell 'em straighten it out
Ah, yeah straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?) straighten it out
That's right y'all straighten it out (say what?)
You got to straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out yeah
Straighten it out it's like that (say what?)

The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, where the Troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bass line's critical
Better than the original who first made it
But now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, seeya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

Yeah, true straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
C'mon (say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out you got to
Straighten it out c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must straighten it out
Say what?
Straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out
The YG's, they must straighten it out
The Hilltop, they muststraighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out
Come on straighten it out
Ah, yeah straighten it out (to close)",6
"All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been

Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
Places I drive all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find some toys when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real so feel I'm sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the kings revalation
Had heard me on the run-dmc's reincarnation
Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide
Every where this black man resides still
Check the monolouge, I'm on a 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers, do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler
But any season or reason we can't take it over

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged ready war?
Known to be the smooth that sat by the door
Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats
Take all that dirty money, set the wash doors and laundromats
You love to gamble now we open an after-hours spot
20 Sacks with the guiness for the jackpot
Members only, playing pool like willie marconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the gs I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to yugenot street
Palled around the screen tv watching the fight
Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it?

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Traveling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missle I probe and seek, many can't critique
My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been?
Still sliding girls in as soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and groupies, condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker feet
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game
Pete rock and c.l. smooth's a household name

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

"Let me take you on a journey through Carmel City
Where CL's God, and the ladies gotta hit me off
Ballin on the set now baby what's the matter
When all this is Hot Sex served on a platter
Enter my flow so I can hit this show with somethin rugged
It's mainly how all the honies dug it
Like every single day and, bounce around the way and
Chicks are never waiting when the bodies start marinating
We expand in player's land to unknowns
To turn my stumbling blocks, into my stepping stones
The pound Donna Karan New York down found
Where there can be no type of slacking in your macking
The whole agenda is for me to decide; the major hustle
Is God, when brothers coincide, with the bonafide
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

C'mon ya'll

Top notch, butterscotch, lyrics hits the mode
To make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude
Your eyes stay glued, when this is popping word is bond
Wifey's gone, now I'm about to get my swerve on
Lay my clothes across the bed, cause I'm here to make a point
Plenty chips, got me balling in a hot joint
Respect the sextafied aura you could never take light
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight
My large releases got me mixing with the dimepieces
And down to rival one of Uncle L's little nieces
In my palace of pleasure, everything is done properly
And if you didn't know, you better ask somebody
Right now, the players are the power structure
Check the roly-poly, now it's time you see the brother
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

It's freaktacular, wasn't hard to get em out the blouse
If only wifey knew, hubby got a stash house
And what moves your man got with so much emphasis
Maybe one or two many get ridiculous
So scandalous, the honey arrives with her crew
And now they're talking bout coming back without you
Yeah my boys are balling, here's the raw deal:
Come to my house, you gotta get naked for real
Indulging, my peoples said let's have a talk
About the time my lady's plane hit New York
I'm bailing off the set, heading for the crib G
Cause I'm the first thing the woman wanna see
Take a hot shower, slip on some linen
Now it's a new time, a new day, a new beginning
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City",6
"We go back and forth, sending this out to my people up north
Tell 'em if you ain't from New York you're soft
Box or throw rocks, fish or cut bait
Cause I fight great, but wait
Here's the hottest joint on lockdown
Ready for release what they call a masterpiece
Covers are blown, known for keeping shit lethal
Cause now I'm like water in the desert for you thirsty people
What's the fixation with all this artillery?
Now you catch a look, saying ""Who are you to question me?""
Giving sighs from enemy lines taking care of my business
Is how you found out Wayne's World was never his
See my pend holds strong for all my cookies in mink
We call all types of bitches running out of ink
Later for ticky mind, avoid like suama
But I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

You know it's my thing, get your bell rang
By the Meccafied slang, the jack of all trades
Couldn't even gang bang, and niggas can't hang
With so many styles, you'd swear the shit was out of Wu-Tang
But the samurai, CL Smooth I
Be slicing, dicing you down when the mic is around
I rebound like Oakley when you provoke me
This is the Chocolate Thai, be careful how you toke me
I razzle dazzle your fragile ass until you pay homage
To the man I plan is holding all the knowledge
In five minutes of funk off my tounge, read the label shown
Is it Pete Rock or Oliver Stone?
Still the same, they remember my name
Kind of reminds me of when Rocket Ismail played for Notre Dame
Invincibility with no vulnerability
Selling more than gold with the killers on my payroll

You'd better watch your step, known for the rep
Of being real but can't accept jealous brothers and others
Who can't relax with pep, and if it was the playoffs
Your ass would get swept and kept on stash
The Tango & Cash competitors bow
Cause I would think we all know who The Don is by now
Making loot at the pace of a horse race
Now once again my friend, the great paperchase
Here's a taste of life in the fast lane
Now house full of chicks, he's stripping off the Don P
With the profound sound, I ride swoops like a hawk
And can only bring the essence of New York
It's the Vernonville daddy, can you comprehend?
How some real live niggas set a new trend
Of being so blasted, smoothest prophets to the brain cell
While I bid you all a farewell",6
"Check the verse in the Bible says man shall never covet
But in your life you put nothing above it, you seem to love it
Invest some stocks to clock what's in my stable
Sweating me like Cain sweating Abel, you're unstable
You couldn't speak, now what's the fake smile for?
The jealousy, that's why you're feeling so insecure
Used to be by my side but now all I see is pride
On the quest to make lucci, got you open wide
It feels funny, cause it never used to be that way
Remember PR back in the day?
Hey, the number's changed and the crib's a little fatter
But if you was real, you'd see it really wouldn't matter
Check the stat in fact yo, don't ever try to peep this
Don't mistake my kindness for a weakness
The name is Pete Rock, I'll take you higher than the izm
I'm on a exodus, Escapism

Yo, check it out
I like to rhyme, no time for silly head games
Strictly known for busting up your head frames
But skins bold, act like they want to know a nigga
Break they neck to show they figure
But yo, you can't gas me up, you can't hype me
Play it cool when it comes to schooling wifey
On the ways of life it's life, checks, and big money
So the next kid will be up on your honey
Sexing your honey, flexing your Benz and your money
Playing you like a crash test dummy, so take it from me
Cause when it happens don't say I never told you so
Peep the verbal lessons in the flow
And ayo, you know they style, and yeah I'm here to warn ya
Getting shaky cause I'm coming up on ya
It's Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth on a major pape mission
Rising to the top, Escapism

I'm sitting back, I got the funk on cruise
While you snooze Pete Rock is steady paying his dues
Putting styles on lock and making beats by the bundle
Scooping more props than Bryant Gumbel, and staying humble
But then you go and have to act that way
I just hit you off the other day!
But this is sick, cause here you come with your crew of derelicts
Talking about you need a pair of kicks, or this or that
You hang around cause the pockets are fat
But when I'm on ""E"" yo, you ain't trying to check for me
You got more game than rugby
You're only stressing the name now that the papes is flowing lovely
So stop searching for idealism
And check the off-beat flow of the Soul Brother with the realism
Shedding some light just like a prism
You can't wait, you can't fake it, Escapism",5
"Capture this funakthon loaded by the Mecca Don
Into the red zone, you spot my skull and crossbone alone
To fill the Watergates, slaughter great, think and meditate
Set behind the pace of the CL's war face
Cras and tints, making blueprints for over six figure salaries
Luchified, cause many did and died
The mic wrecka, study Mecca, now building
Cause I love my shorties like Jesus loved children
Cause being smooth is the science I crafted
To a state, when they incarsarate me I wanna be free
And play some D on the high-scoring thrill from the Veronville
Taking my yards with no bodyguards
My click's the first round draft pick for time in prison
So the only way to cover that is clean living
Respect given, hear the bell go ""ding""
It's like Tyson stepping back into the ring, soon as I

Ladies and gentlemen for dead presidents it represents
Now hear what it's like when I (get on the mic)
It's strike cause every Nike I wear is kicking ass there
Too dope to scare and too damn smooth to care
So flick your lighters in the air, and let me blow the roof off
The Collesseum plus I got to get per diem
All dueces file out, and leave the dimes to the front row
And when I say ""Go"" I want 'em showing lovin'
Tossing dough, cause with the daddy unemployed
And the old earth raising me, any other rugged nigga's history
No mystery, I'm physical in action
So guess relaxing is a weekend with Toni Braxton
On your TV is me, incredible MC, B
With the P to the R, my break a ways can bounce for days
This fillets, I'm trucking jewels like Eric B
And all you corny fools can't see me, oh my my my

Healthy, wealthy, and wise is your size
Come and try the hardcore, set on down by every law
Moving in your Lex trecks out a sextivity
At its highest level of funktagious served in major
He's the real Mabel, overqualified to be luchified
Pete Rock's the god when my stiz-ile profile
Slide into the Milky Way, the Carmel King's sing
We're back on crazy to put the duke up in Daisy
Amazingly, none of y'all can faze me never
Add the spice to make you shoop like Salt N Pepa
How large is he? Mastered my degree in mic surgery
With plans to retire at the tender age of 30
Jah is what I cherish, all informers must perish
On the down low, lift my peoples from the ghetto
In every borough CL is quite thorough
In do or die don't try when I anni",6
"What's goin on baby?
Ain't nothin' it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live

""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

Feel the vibe when it's bumpin' in my tribe steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin' my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doin' trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, livin' well
And never cease to flip the hottest dime piece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slippin off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

You want a slow wind under my ceilin' fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rockin' you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasin' hits, takin' love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop fakin' me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dime pieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinkin totally nude with no limits
Goin' through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showin' nothin' but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doin them things, listen

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin' in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin' this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""",6
"Introducing funk from the yard, collecting strictly knockouts
The broters I sparred, which only means the man got nothing to prove
On a power move made by the CL Smooth
Live 495 I arrive in person
Hard dialogue without a whole bunch of cursing
It's my perrogitive, so back up and live, fool
As long as they don't violate everything's cool, cause it's all good
Understood is the smoothest daddy with the roughest raps
Am I thinking about blowing the spot? Perhaps
Carry straps on strips for the trigger-happy pirates
Where ladies catch fits steady reaching for my privates
But hold, how I unfold my whole repotoire
Now here we are at home to make another superstar
With Rob-O and Deda with the P.R
But nevertheless it's CL Smooth

""In the flesh""

Rob-O's at the top of the list, so bust this
Stick to funk like Scotch, the top-notch vocalist
You don't stop, cause I can illustrate with the needle
Penetrating straight to the souls of many people
Is there any evil? On this path I'm innovating
Stil faking, put down your pads and stop waiting
See the year of the fly MC is here, so stand clear
I'm facing the Gods with no fear
Rob-O, East Coast, uptown
MCing the most and spreading the Mecca all around
Selecting the sound to make the party people hound
The DJ for more of what I say in '94
It's like that, so don't stop
It's like this, so God bless
Soul Brothers get down with no stress
Yeah INI's representing in the flesh

""In the flesh""

Even in the mirror, it just doesn't get any clearer
I hear a funky beat and I gotta get nearer
KABOOM! Stepping in the sound room mellow
A dangerous flavorous fellow, hello
Style and grace, the original's in this piece
In the place right along with the pace
Nevertheless, in the flesh no quest
The sex in the system, of course I'm fresh
I rest in the Villes, the skills is big
To a level of extravagence, the talent's all balanced
The extreme dopeness for the nation
D. is the inital, MC's the occupation
Five master hype, light the color of the skin
Once the beat roll, my goal is to win
My friend the best, the real side yes
I rest my case in your face in the flesh

""In the flesh"" 

Soul Brother supreme to catch wreck in the flesh
So check one two and a mic test
Now clear the room, I scoped you with the wide angle zoom
Trying to overstand my funk tunes
Coming soon, so chill, don't stress The Creator
I'll kick the funk loop from here to Cal Tjader
And cross the fader, and pack the lines on my paper
With rhymes so tough, who got the flavor?
Plus the knack to rock, I'm steady heating up the spot
The Chocolate Boy Wonder making heads bop
In slow motion, domes crack open like the pavement
Off some shit I made down in the basement
The funk ambassador, asking you to get with the pro-
Fessional, yo there's no question I can flow
Time to slide, you know the P.R. will provide
The real and still I feel the vibe, I'm in the flesh

""In the flesh""",6
"I'd like to introduce myself

Check it out and give me my 'spect

Hit the lights and I appear beyond the stratosphere of Meccable function
And if you're pretty let your lady sleep in Carmel City
Begin and end the day on Lennon hunts for beachfronts
To lit blunts, now all agreed we're sippin OJ with the Dom P
Bounce and bring it like it counts to be Luccified
CL is sextified and women spell me nationwide
You say you want my lips where and I can grab your what?
I love your hips legs breasts faces with the firm butt
Now feel the muscle when I hustle in the bedsheets
Cause my manly treats can hit the fridge for more sweet
SPLASH, and let me do my thing til it's hot and sweaty
Reload the CamCorder, I guess by then you'll be ready
Cause All My Children got One Life to Live
But knockin wifey out the box is clearly a negative
I'm in rugged wears with fancy facial wears
And all the real shit come in pairs, and bounce em in the house y'all

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house

Back again, I'm here to win, to bust rhymes on beats again
Copycats and rugrats, sit back and watch a champion
It's time to wreck shop and show the world I'm true to hip-hop
So check the style and peace to niggas in the penile
Now umm, it's the original Funky Chicken tactic
I run game on your brain for the fame cause I'm active
You try to follow in my footsteps, you can't do it
I'm pullin your card it ain't hard, I don't have to prove it
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the utmost
From coast to coast, the music makes you overdose
You fiend, for the gangsta lean, I makes you scream
Rugged Bro Soul on the scene
A.k.a. the funk doer, numero uno, that means
Number one I get the job done plus I pack a gun
So run, and tell your peoples you'll be on the lookout
It's all about ""Who's in the House?"" with the funk

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house

Money up steps the new era of my lyrical terror
Funkadelic for lightin up spots ever since little tots
When the dust settle I'm packin heavy metal plenty
The drop'll slaughter many, strictly off illegal entry
It's elementary Watson, I drive a Benz not a Datsun
Before my kicks hit the stage, we've been Foot Locking
Body rockin to keep the ladies flockin with a concoction
Rippin your blouse for no less than arrest in Morehouse
My teeth prints where my knife slits, we train em
And scar em like pits, off vibes of the Mecca joint
Vibe to position, never runnin out of ammunition
Now to the heart, I'm steppin with a concealed weapon
Nothing's calm when the bomb blaze you know the phrase
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth knockin nowadays
Eastside kid, you don't want none, so catch a relay
I'm lettin off on anybody tryin to steal my DJ

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house
Check it out, give me my 'spect
Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house",5
"On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

It's death before dishonor
Strap the vest down tight when you bring the drama
Now raise up off mine, and taste it in the raw
Before snipers on the floor galore, in my hardware store
Nightmares of thirsty crooks, niggas all acting fishy working off the books
Painting pictures of poverty, causing armed robbery
And if provoke every last one gets smoked
No doubt for real it's like wildlife
Where thugs forever pull caps and always keep a knife
Cause on the strip warefare's inevitable, hot steel's incredible
And it's a pride the revolution won't be televised
As I supply and demand, as I build my currency to expand, call it progress
When I bless my territory all respect due
But can niggas keep it real? it's on you

On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

Step into the dragon's lair, where cl's the don and pete's the creator
Now praise the most high and represent the best
Cause the number one killer of black men is stress
The armed and dangerous, the bulletproof
Couldn't stop the homicide of another youth
Penetrating your body parts with hollow point shells, you fraud
Cause vengence is mine said the lord, indeed
My own click now turns greedy
Out of twelve of my soldiers, one will decieve me
With salt in the game, shame the family and push
My black ass straight into a terrifying ambush
The whole empire's at stake
Mastering the streets, devil the mental won't break and turn snake
For pete's sake you gotta be true to the crew
So if niggas want to set it, it's on you

On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

Capture the beast within me, beware when it's moving deep in new york city
The diabolical gangster chronicle mob scenes in all directions
The type of connections to get your wig split
Submit the wanted signs posted, chickens spots for major knots you get
Toasted
To the head piece, I release firepower, only I'm controlling
We put in work and got the right brothers rolling
When hell kicks off we lick off
Keeping mine hard like stone from the red zone, to each his own
Smile in my face behind my back you talk trash
But my pockets hit empty and my lexus crashed
But not in your wildest dreams
Hear my name in all the scandals and all the schemes, I rest in queens
The veronville's my capital, so memorize the cuts
Then give you two more seconds to get off these nuts, it's on you

On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

Check it, grap luva, if you're in the house
Just get on the mic and show 'em what it's all about

It's all about the wicked check one two
Cause I rips a microphone and pass it to my crew
I don't drink no brew, I smoke nuff spliffs, I don't have no riffs
So check me as I shoot the gift
Rip rhymes, freestyle rhymes
Off top of the dome every time
I'm glad this shit is going on tape
So I can escape into the beat and make nuff papes
Word to god, kicking nuff freestyle rhymes",5
"One two, one two y'all
One two, check it out
Got my man CL
Can't forget my man, Cee-Lo
Can't forget money earnin', Mount Vernon
Can't forget New Roch'
Can't forget Westchester
Can't forget umm CL, hit me off

Feel the funk by the rap czars in sports cars
Comin atcha now you listen at the feet of a master
Caution, not Wheel of Fortune, here's a portion
Of untamedness, approachin famous, for miscellaneous
The track get crackin though, unexplainable
When I ground a jewel, sound is simply uncontainable
Release my soul, but never make the mistake
And play me like a stone cold fruitcake man
Cause you can never fathom G the dough we want so
My flow's the steadiest, to never leave us penniless
Come on down to the very necessary legendary
Well the more the merry stickin women type of villian
The evidence relentless, I ride to see you magnatized
Mecca to begin you're locked in no doubt
The label better push this, so we can pay the rent
You can season the pot well, but here's The Main Ingredient

The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient
Yo, The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient
Yo, The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient
The Main Ingredient y'all
Yo, The Main Ingredient, kick it CL

I know you wonder what kind of way is that to think:
Put all the wackest rappers on a boat and let it sink
Don't blink; next thing you see you spot is taken
No Jax I'm Fakin' soldiers took the whole reservation
On a scale of one to ten, we move rather swiftly
Want a dimepiece but we'll settle for an eight-fifty
Don't blow mine, your trump card is exposed to pages
Now your beginning's already at the final stages
Pumpin like 12 gauges from a shotgun blast
I never saw people run so fast, aight?
Stay up all night, then sleep all day
Makin big Lucci and would have it no other way
In conjunction, with the function, as stated
Orchestrated by the Soul Brother nickel plated
Tell the judge you were foolish, and try to be lenient
Cause you never had the The Main Ingredient

The Main Ingredient
Hit the third verse off kid

This cap is peeled layin joints like a minefield
When dynamite's my rhythm this is East coast terrorism
The Vernon-ville's Mecca Don, formin Voltron tactics
Let off three verses and the crowd panics
Get em all, the kingpin of the Player's Ball
Now every tramp in your camp's going AWOL
My Lucci situation is A Daily Operation
On the strip, I refine you like Tales From the Crypt
Right here's the real shit, and all that other's counterfeit
Funk to let you know exactly what you're dealin with
P-R slash, C-L smash, love to spend cash
For proper livin, slidin up in wealthy women
Stick your hand in my pants, and grab the mic's no crime
Cause like Sisters With Voices, it's about time
For you to respect my whole foundation precisely
Be obedient, to The Main Ingredient

Yo, The Main Ingredient
The Main Ingredient
Yo, The Main Ingredient
The Main Ingredient
Check out the funk y'all
Mic Check, one two
CL Smooth, and Pete Rock
Comin back, for ninety-four
Can't forget
Get on, to get on
It's time to get on, peace to I-n-I
Yeah, can't forget Baby Pah
Can't forget the whole roster
One two
Check it
It's The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient, y'all
The Main Ingredient, bust it",6
"You're everything that I dream about, talk about
Walk around and brag about, cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say, or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your loving, but hey
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're making me nervous, I don't deserve this, I'm Swayze
I wish I could be but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm telling you how I feel, shit is real
Now I don't really want to play myself so I say to myself:
""Self get a grip and don't slip""
Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from out of town
I get down, I've been around, I ain't no hand-me-down
So you gotta show respect for me if you're checking for me
And don't sweat me cause I really don't want no sweat on me
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stayed dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar can I get a sip?
Well maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal, what's the haps, where we at now?
Keeping it strong, moving it along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexing you
And I'll be swimming in some trim with a beachfront view
Cause all I wanna do is get next to you
Now leave your crew so we can step into my hideaway
So I can step into it right away
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Before you sit back and think I ain't saying nothing
You need to sit back and think about what I'm saying
Now relaying, my carmel flow
So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night I crack her open just like a lobster
(My CL Smooth) It's all good baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from making lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?",6
"Open Sesame, stepping through the mist, it's the specialist
Coming to box, and flooded with rocks
We'll get down for mine, the kind that makes cement feel us
Standing in the company of killers
Follow my trail as I walk through the valley of death
Left, to fear no evil, cause what I grip is legal
I'm hot like yard, the point guard of this group, on the loop
Never your right, raising all your game type tonight
Entering the level of high gear
You'd think it took a Bob Marley spliff to get here
Front to rear God of the drugs that you're hearing
While my neighbors say we need to be jailed for rackateering
Now appearing, Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the jugular
Now you got Mecca and the Soul Brother
Slightly, you might raise a hair of doubt
But if we don't rock the spot, The Sun Won't Come Out

Check it out, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You know we can't Reminisce
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

Un-chained heat, I hustle on the street or beat
To keep you on the edge of your seat, you consumer
A QB-like Boomer, the ultimate team
But if I wake up in another woman's bed, I'mma scream
I'm settin up shop pop to overthrow Castro
Chokin over Noriega's Garcia Vegas
Guess who supplies the pies and dope triples
Now she leaks ass cheeks, pearly whites and titty nipples
Would CL ever trick loot on PC?
Even if I never had sonny boy I disagree
Cut the small talk, I give more marks than a school of sharks
On attack, so keep your ass back
When it's wack you get a thumbs down, another record deal wasted
Listen man, find another occupation man
Here's the persuasion, blazin one amazin route that's all about
The Sun Won't Come Out

Yo, so check it out, with Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You can't Reminisce to T.R.O.Y
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

I rule chicks off acoustics, watchin the Knicks
We up ten, but need to stop shootin bricks
Put the jailhouse funk in under stars
Til the lines on my looseleaf, look like some metal bars
My forecast hits a megablast, and what I invent
A pack of bloodhounds could never get the scent
Payin off the beast now my bills increase
If there's a five dollar rock sold in the park I want a piece
The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness
Cause any verse rips a total eclipse for sun rays
Anyways was the phrase back in my younger days (so check it out)
Now the God displays the attribute, dealin with heat
From the bassment, enterin the streets you meet
Pete Rock and CL Smooth and when you see what it's about
You know The Sun Came Out, now pass my shades

Yo, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
We can't Reminisce
Yo, if we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Ghettoes of the Mind
If you know what I'm talking about
You know The Sun Won't Come Out, so check it

One two, Pete Rock and CL Smooth for ninety-four
Breakin you off somethin proper
Check it, peace y'all",6
"Check it out 
Ahh yeah 
Back again with another hit smash 
Pete Rock and CL Smooth 

We got the groove for you 
So go call your crew 
And let em know we in the house 
CL hit em off with the verses 

Never judge a book by the cover; discover the Soul Brother 
With the Mecca Don Workin' brunette to blonde 
How many Edison Con when I respond in full black 
with us havin' the Vernon Villians back to back 

Amazing grace when I face the great paperchase 
For real it's long overdue, so I don't want to talk to you 
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted 
every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted 

I'm livin through my son so daddy see it this way 
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA 
No doubt I with a 'piece, down in Mecca, all crazy 
to the lady, none of this is make-believe 

I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century 
Battle physically, conquer mentally 
Essentially, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, why'know, I'll take you there 

[Chorus]
C... L... what you gonna do 
You... know... you can make me Boo 
Over... and over again 
Come on, and take me there 

Control now so in the future see me callin' the shots 
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics 
I'm blowin' up spots for knots in the millennium years 
And now I drop it on my peers, brings Tears and Fears 

And now the question manifest in my only 
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue 
That brings a world of intrigue and glamor to my arsenal 
of Gods, pimps to players and layers of Deceptions 

My whole mindstate gravitate to weapon 
Makin people in the business get a misconception 
It ain't hard to the core, it ain't Sex on the Beach 
It's just another plateau the brothers have to reach 

Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided 
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided 
No question, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there 

[Chorus]

Set it so I can make em all respect my fame 
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game 
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay 
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away 

Chose for Negroes, the most hypnotical flows 
on the planet, another East coast track rose, God dammit 
My theme, to mainstream's the knocker 
Only time I get right as block is when my lucci's on lock 

Pretty much I'm comin through in the clutch see 
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel 
Or is it just my style of hustle makin a mark 
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park 

It was dark, when I brought it to the light, despite 
my staff's got me takin nothin but champagne baths 
Now the aftermath's dealin with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there 

[Chorus] 

Just come on 
Take me right where I want to be 
Come on 
Come on to you and me 

Come on 
Ohhh 

Keep doin' it baby 
Check it out, bust it 

[Chorus: x2]",6
"Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

There she lays, never the nonsense
The mood to watch her focus on and
Slide so she can ride the man who's born to be sextified
Study my flicks if only chicks knew the mix for better brands
When power lands the sister had other plans
The plot is set for her to wed giver her dad's permission
To marry the next boss in line in his position
Overprotective, the objective is never to leave her
Taking street, who pack the heat, now meet the Black Caesar
Bought her diamonds and furs, silky jammies isn't hers
But deep down I think a simple man she prefers
Every kiss was a death wish, every plan was a let down
Stopping in tears she pulls over by the playground
Clearing her vision, spots a game through the schoolyard fence
Sneakers squeeking, ball bouncing, looking so intense
And since her hobby was photography with nothing to do
Cool, she takes a flick or two

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

A couple of weeks go by, clocking the boys around the town
Her mommy shopping, daddy dealing, leaving night all time around
For her to execute her a level to break the family ties
To gamble her future on the love, murder, money, and lies
Watch out, the woman's about to love and claim her king
So she drove up in the ghetto looking to do her thing
Checking the brothers going crazy when the car skirts by the flow
I keep it real and peep it all from my window
So please, the lady's heading upstairs the first door
The second deliver my clothes, the third, run my tub water
Every way she represented made sense to me
When black is out of state, building spots, making lucci
The wind blows the candles, now the moon shines on my chest
But nevertheless I gently rest my head on her breast
But danger lurks in the wings based on how the cards read 'em
I think she'd better tell 'em

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

The blackest of the seeds to dawn stepping with two briefcases
Son you bless your people when you conquer like Hannibal
When I was about your age, I ran the numbers for money
I'm picturing him and John Gotti hanging in the study
I grew to be large in Crooklyn with your daddy back in the day
We were ready to take Harlem before he passed away
Women and booze, the weapon I choose then was truly major
I'm ringside with Don King when Ali fought Frazier
Scars and metals, when the mob settles I was flexing
My daughter was born so I called the X for some direction
Your father's words are like the Bible to black
But beware, he came barging in your room and you wasn't there
You let your mind wander, taste and face the search party
Left the grounds fully loaded with the tre pound
Then come in deep on the creep to find you and me
Cause you can't stop destiny

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real",5
"Who keeps it methods and orthodox, who caught the props
Who's styles are shit, who's gonna rock?
On to the break of dawn, you wanna battle, pay the price
Mathematically precise, smooth and plus nice
With a flow that's like a mailman or letter carrier
Rob-O brings the ghetto area
Funk flavor through your neighborhood, state, town, or borough
Stay down, I don't think I'm quite thorough
Not your average rapper (Listen)
Cause in a sec I write some shit to blast your wack ass to Mecca
See Rob's the most Mecca
To grab the microphone and yes y'all it
To school these dreds and stress these bald heads
The INI's in the house (You don't stop)
Pete Rock, Grap Luva, Mark, and Polo rising and you don't stop
We let the funk slide and let God be our guide
Flowing from the Vernon worldwide

It's the funk god, taking you worldwide, so bust it
Flowing over beats cause it's a must, kid
That I proceed to fix the hardcore in the mix
Check one two with the flow that fits
I make the hits that soar, I put the wreck in the raw
'94 in your local record store
It's Pete Rock and CL, the Main Ingredient
Now leave your wack style home, cause you won't be needing it
I grab the mic and get wreck for real
You hear me on the wax, kid, you see me on the steel
Can you feel the funk as I inject?
Then God protect it, hold the mic, see I select it
To keep it crazy versatile
But still underground, packs the four pound cause it's wild
In this place you'll find it hard to hide
Soul Brother and I'm going worldwide

Now who's the greatest? Few debate this, you're still figuring?
Well perish the thought, there's none bigger in
This act son, Mecca is all I attract
You're wack, son, yeah your talent's a fraction
While I'm nice, as Christ, there's two religions
So envision a messiah on a mission, the competition
I'll stop your wishing point blank cause you lost it
Your joint sank, your soft style's exhausted
And now it's mandatory, you stand before me amazed and awed
Giving praise, you're the God
Rob cipher's born, most Mecca supreme
A fly MC with the self-esteem
You keep it wholesome and still I relax a bit
I play your shit out like ??? cause my wig out has to hit
I'm steadily encouraging head bops while you're scurrying to get props
I'm worldwide

Yo, check out the rhyme buster, pulling niggas through the wringer
I'm not a singer, as I conduct with one finger
It's the orchestrater, mutilator, master funktator
I've got mad flow from here to Asia
Cause I'll amaze ya with the skills that I possess
Not categorized with all the rest
So I suggest if you're in the way step aside
Cause Pete Rock is coming worldwide",5
"What's going on baby?
Ain't nutting - it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live
Let's get right to it

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

Feel the vibe, when it's bumping in my tribe, steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doing trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, living well
And never cease to flip the hottest dimepiece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slipping off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

You want a slow wind under my ceiling fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rocking you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasing hits, taking love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop faking me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dimepieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinking totally nude with no limits
Going through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showing nothing but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doing them things, listen

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up",6
"One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fires were burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
And he said, ""Boys, I'm not turning
I'm headed for a land that's far away
Besides the crystal fountains
So come with me, we'll go and see
The Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
There's a land that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night.
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
And the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey too
You can paddle all around it
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin.
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in.
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws nor picks,
I'm bound to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.",5

"Now Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Oh Lord, how they did love
Swore to be true to each other true as the stars above
He was her man but he wouldn't do her wrong.

Now Frankie went down to the corner
Just for a bucket of beer
She said Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong.

I don't want to cause you no trouble
Woman, I ain't gonna lie
But I saw your lover an hour ago
With a girl named Nellie Blie
He's your man but he's doin' you wrong.

Now Frankie looked over the transom
She saw to her surprise
There on the cab sat Johnny
Making love to Nellie Blie
He's my man, but he's doin' me wrong.

Frankie threw back her comona
Took out her little 44
Rutty too-too three times she shot right through
That hardwood door
Shot her man, he was doin' her wro

Now bring out your rubber tired hearses
Bring out your rubber tired hack
I'm taken said the man to the graveyard
But only six of 'em called him back
He was my man but he done me wrong.

Bring round a thousand policemen
Bring 'em around today
To lock me down in that dungeon cell
And throw that key away
I shot my man, he was doin' me wrong.

Now Frankie she said to the warden
What are they goin' to do
The warden he said to Frankie
It's the electric chair for you
You shot your man, he was doin' you wrong.

Now this story has no moral
This story has no end
This story just goes to show
That there ain't no good in man
He was her man, but he done her wrong",4

Just a little ways with me
And as we walked and we would talk
All about our wedding day

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity.""

I took her by her golden curls
I drug her down to the river-side
An I there threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And going home between twelve and one
I cried ""Lord, what have I've done?""
I've killed the girl I love
Because she would not marry me

To a city fair rode I.
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by.
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound it's loud tattoo.
But the Angelus Bells o'er the Liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew.
Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Than at Sulva or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.
Their bravest fell and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Springing of the year.
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few.
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew.
And back through the glen
I rode again.
And my heart with grief was sore.
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see n'more.
But to and fro in my dreams I go
And I kneel and pray for you.
For slavery fled the glorious dead
When you fell in the foggy dew.",6
"In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
She died of a fever and no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!",5
"It happened an hour ago,
Way down in this tunnel of coal,
Gas caught fire from somebody's lamp.
And the miners are choking in smoke.

Goodbye to Dickie and Honey,
Goodbye to the wife that I love.
Lot of these men not coming home,
Tonight when the work whistle blows.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

It looks like the end for me,
And all of my buddies I see.
We're all writing letters to children we love,
Please carry our word to our wives.

We, found a little place in the air,
Crawled and drug ourselves here.
But the smoke is bad and the fumes coming in,
And the gas is burning my eyes.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

Forgive me for the things I done wrong,
I love you lots more than you know.
When the night whistle blows and I don't come home,
Do all that you can to help mom.

I can hear the moans and groans,
More than a hundred good men.
Just work and fight and try to see,
That this never happens again.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

My eyes are blinded with fumes,
But it sounds like the men are all gone,
'Cept Joe Valentini, Fred Gussler and George,
Trapped down in this hell hole of fire.

Please name our new baby Joe,
So he'll grow up like big Joe.
He'll work and he'll fight and he'll fix up the mines,
So fire can't kill daddy no more.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.",5
"Farethee well Old Joe Clark
Farethee well I say
Farethe well Old Joe Clark
I'm bound go go away
I will not go to Old Joe's house
I'll tell ya the reason why
Every floor in Old Joes's house
Is filled with chicken pie
Old Joe Clark he did take sick
And what do ya think ailed him?
He drank a churn of butter milk
And then his stomach failed him
I will not marry an old maid
And I'll tell ya the reason why
Her neck's so long and stringy boys
I'm afraid she'll never die
Old Joe Clark he did get drunk
And he sat down to his supper
He leaned over at the dinner table
And stoved his nose in the butter",4
"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",5
"Ira Hayes,
Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

[Chorus]

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

[Chorus]

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[Chorus]

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died",5
"Be kind to your parents
Though they don't deserve it
Remember that grown ups
Is a difficult stage of life

They're apt to be nervous
And over excited
Confused by their
Daily storm and strife

Just keep in mind
Though it seems hard I know
Most parents were children long ago

Incredible
So treat them with patience
And kind understanding
In spite of the foolish things they do

Some day you might wake up
And find you're a parent too",6
"There was once a farmer, walking down the road whistling a tune to himself. 
He said, ""Dog-gone, I wish I had some words to that tune. 
But all I've got is the melody."" Just then he came to a little bridge, 
And he leaned on the railing looking down at the brook. 
There was a big old bullfrog, hopping from bank to bank. 

Well, the bullfrog looked up and saw the farmer and decided to show off. 
He took an extra special big hop - z-z-z-z-tt! 
He landed, splash! in the water and got himself all wet. 
The farmer laughed and laughed and started singing
""Way down south in the yankety-yank, a bull frog jumped from bank to bank, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do! 
He stubbed his toe and fell in the water,
You could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do.""

Now the farmer went walking down the road 
Feeling mighty proud of himself for making up a song. 
He went down to the corner store, bought himself some groceries, 
A pair of work gloves and a plug of chewing tobacco, and said, 
""Oh, before I go, I have to sing you my new song.""

""Go on home,"" says the storekeeper, 
""I'm busy here, can't you see all these customers?""

""I won't pay you any money unless you let me sing you my song!""

""Well, sing it and get it over with then,"" 
Said the storekeeper.

The farmer began to sing and the man in the store cried out, 
""That's a w-o-o-nderful song, gather round everybody, 
We'll have a party."" And he passed round the free Coca Colas 
And the free soda-crackers, and everyone was stamping on the floor.

Meanwhile, all the wives and children back home 
Were sitting down to supper, and, where's father?

The mother said, 
""Children, you better run down to the corner store and fetch your old man. 
He's probably down there wasting his time as usual.""

So all the children run down the road. 
They run inside the corner store. 
You know, they heard all that music, 
They forgot about coming home. 
The children started singing 

And they were passing around the free Coca-Colas and 

Now, in every farmhouse it was the same situation. 
The mother said to themselves, ""This has gone far enough. 
Supper's getting cold. 'Spect us to work all the day nobody show up?""

They reached over on the stove 
And grabbed some heavy frying pans 
And start down the road with a mad look in their eyes. 
Somebody's going to get beaned.

Well, they get near and they hear all that pretty music, 
And they forget all about being mad. 
They drop the frying pans in the gutter, 
Walk into the store, and the mothers start singing! 
Way down yonder in the yankety-yank, 
A bullfrog jumped from bank to bank 
And they're passing round the free Coca-Colas 
And the free soda crackers, 
And everybody is stamping on the floor!

Meanwhile out in the barns all the cows started talking, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be milked and it's getting mighty uncomfortable!"" 
So the cows left their stalls, they wobbled out of the barn, 
And down the road right into the corner store. 
And the cows started singing, 
""Moo, moo, moo, moo, moo moo, moo, moo, moo, moo."" 

And the cow's tails were swishing out the windows, 
And they were stamping on the floor,
And drinking the free Coca-Colas and eating the free soda 

Out in the barnyard all the chickens said, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be fed and we're getting hungry!"" 
So the chickens hopped over the fence, 
Hopped down the road, hopped into the store, 
And the chickens started; (Chicken imitation to tune). 
And the chicken were stamping on the floor and drinking the free Coca C 

Meanwhile all the barns started talking to each other. 
""We feel mighty lonely,"" they said, ""without any cows or any chickens. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
So the barns picked themselves off their foundations and galumphed down the road, 
And s-q-u-e-e-z-e-d themselves into that corner store, 
Believe it or not. Did you ever hear a rusty hinge on a barn door? 
That's the way the barns sang

Out in the fields all the grass says, 
""Where is everybody? The cows are supposed to come and eat us. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
And the grass picked itself up and swished off down the road, 
And swished right into the store and started singing

Of course, when the grass was gone, the fields were gone, 
So the brook didn't have any banks to flow between. 
It said, ""I've got to go someplace,"" 
So it bubbled down the road. 
It bubbled right up into the corner store and the brook started
Bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl.

The brook was bubbling up and down the stairway! 
The grass was growing out the chimney! 
Feathers flying through the air! 
Cows tails swishing through the windows! 
Everybody stamping on the floor 
And drinking the free Coca-Cola 
And eating the free soda-crackers!

Meanwhile, there's the bullfrog in mid-air!

He looks down, there's nothing underneath him. 
He looks over and there's no bank to land on. 
He says, ""Where am I?""
And he starts hopping down the road. 
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

""Hey, what's all that racket down at the corner store?"" says the frog.

""Why 
They're singing! 
They're singing about ME!"" 
And he was so proud he puffed himself up with pride.

And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he boom!

He exploded. 
Cows, barns, chickens, farmers, the whole corner store went up in the air, 
And everybody floated down 
And landed right where they were supposed to have been all the time. 
They all sat down eating supper again, 
Feeling kind of foolish for themselves.

Next day they went out to find the frog. 
They looked high, they looked low. 
Coca-Cola bottles and soda crackers in all directions. 
But no frog.

So all there is left of the frog is the song. 
We might as well sing 'er once again.

""Way down yonder in the yankety-yank""",5

"On the streets of New York city when the hour was getting late
Young men armed with knives and guns, young men armed with hate
And Lou Marsh stepped between them and died there in his tracks
For one man is no army when the city turns its back

Now the streets are empty, now the streets are dark
So keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park
For the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight
Death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night

He left behind a chamber of a church he served so long
For he learned the prayers of distant men will never right the wrongs
His church became an alley and his pulpit was the street
He made his congregation from the boys he used to meet

There were two gangs approaching in spanish Harlem town
The smell of blood was in the air, the challenge was laid down
He felt their blinding hatred, and he tried to save their lives
And the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives

Will Lou Marsh lie forgotten in his cold and silent grave?
Will his memory still linger on, in those he tried to save?
All of us who knew him will now and then recall
And shed a tear on poverty, tombstone of us all",4
"Walking down death row,
I sang for three men destined for the chair;
Walking down death row,
I sang of lives and loves in other years.
Walking down death row, I sang of hopes that used to be.
Through the bars, into each separate cell,
Yes, I sang to one and two and three.
""If you'd only only stuck together you'd not be sitting here!
""If you could have loved each other's lives, you'd not be sitting here!
""And if only this you could believe,
""You might still, you might still be reprieved.""

Walking down death row,
I turned the corner and found to my surprise;
There were women there as well,
With babies in their arms, before my eyes.
Walking down death row,
I tried once more to sing of hopes that used to be.
But the thought of that contraption, down the hall,
Waiting for whole families, one dozen, two or three,
""If you'd only stuck together, you'd not be here!
""If you could've loved another's child as well as your own, you'd not be sitting here!
""And if only this you could believe,
""You might still, you might still be reprieved.""

Walking down death row,
I concentrated, singing to the young.
I sang of hopes that flickered still,
I tried to mouth their many separate tongues.
Walking down death row,
I sang of life and love that still might be.
Singing down death row,
To each separate human cell, One billion, two, or three,
""If we'd only stick together, we'd not be here!
""If we could learn to love each other's lives, we'd not be sitting here!
""And if only this we could believe,
""We still might, we still might be reprieved.""",5

"Sailing down my dirty stream
Still I love it and I'll keep the dream
That some day, though maybe not this year
My Hudson River will once again run clear

It starts high in the mountains of the north
Crystal clear and icy trickles forth
With just a few floating wrappers of chewing gum
Dropped by some hikers to warn of things to come

At Glens Falls, five thousand honest hands
Work at the consolidated paper plant
Five million gallons of waste a day
Why should we do it any other way?

Down the valley one million toilet chains
Find my Hudson so convenient place to drain
And each little city says, ""Who, me?
Do you think that sewage plants come free?""

Out in the ocean they say the water's clear
But I live right at Beacon here
Half way between the mountains and sea
Tacking to and fro, this thought returns to me

Well it's Sailing up my dirty stream
Still I love it and I'll dream
That some day, though maybe not this year
My Hudson and my country will run clear",5
"Come fill up your glasses and set yourselves down.
I'll tell you a story of somebody's town.
It isn't too near and it's not far away.
It's not a place where I'd want to stay.

[Chorus:]
Now the people are scratching all over the street
Because the rabbits had nothing to eat.

The winter came in with a cold icy blast.
It killed off the flowers and killed off the grass.
The rabbits were starving because of the freeze.
They started eating the bark off the trees.

[Chorus]

The farmers said, ""This sort of thing just won't do.
Our trees will be dead when the rabbits get through.
We'll have to poison the rabbits, it's clear;
Or we'll have no crops to harvest next year.""

[Chorus]

So they brought the poison and spread it around.
And soon dead rabbits began to be found.
Dogs ate the rabbits and the farmers just said,
""We'll poison those rabbits 'til the last dog is dead.""

[Chorus]

Up in the sky there were meat-eating fowls.
The dead rabbits poisoned the hawks and the owls.
Thousands of field mice the hawks used to chase
Were multiplying all over the place.

[Chorus]

The fields and the meadows were barren and brown.
The mice got hungry and moved into town.
The city folks took the farmer's advise
And all of them started to poison the mice.

[Chorus]

There were dead mice in all the apartments and flats.
The cats ate the mice and the mice killed the cats.
The smell was awful and I'm glad to say
I wasn't the man hired to haul them away.

[Chorus]

All through the country and all through the town
There wasn't a dog or cat to be found.
The fleas asked each other, ""Where can we stay?""
They've been on the people from then 'til this day.

[Chorus]

All you small creatures that live in this land
Stay clear of the man with the poisonous hand!
A few bails of hay might keep you alive
But he'll pay more to kill you than let you survive.

"Come and take a walk with me through this green and growing land
Walk through the meadows and the mountains and the sand
Walk through the valleys and the rivers and the plains
Walk through the sun and walk through the rain

Here is a land full of power and glory
Beauty that words cannot recall
Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom
Her glory shall rest on us all (on us all)

From Colorado, Kansas, and the Carolina's too
Virginia and Alaska, from the old to the new
Texas and Ohio and the California shore
Tell me, who could ask for more?

Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor
Only as free as the padlocked prison door
Only as strong as our love for this land
Only as tall as we stand

But our land is still troubled by men who have to hate
They twist away our freedom & they twist away our fate
Fear is their weapon and treason is their cry
We can stop them if we try",5
"Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they're gone

If I'd known before I courted
I never would've courted none
I'd a lock my heart in a box of golden
And fastened it up with silver pin

I wish I were some little sparrow
And I had wings and I could fly
I'd fly away to my false true lover
And when he'd speak, I would deny

But I am not some little swallow
I have no wings, neither can I fly
So I will sit down here to weep in sorrow
And try to pass my troubles by

Oh don't you remember our days of courting
When your head lay upon my breast
You could make me believe by the falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the west

Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they're gone",7
