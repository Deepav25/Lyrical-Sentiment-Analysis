"I was born and raised in east Virginia,
North Carolina I did go.
There I met some pretty little woman
But her name and age I do not know.

Well her hair it was a light brown color
And her cheeks were ruby red.
On her breast she wore white lilies,
Where I long to lay my head

I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun refused to shine
Than to see you with another one, darling,
To know you never will be mine.

I was born and raised in east Virginia,
North Carolina I did go.
There I met some pretty little woman
But her name I did not know.",5
"My father's mansion's many rooms
Have room for all of His children
As long as we do share His love
And see that all are free.

And see that all are free to grow
And see that all are free to know
And free to open or to close
The door of their own room.

What is a room without a door
Which sometimes locks or stands ajar?
What is a room without a wall
To keep out sight and sound from all?

And dwellers in each room should have
The right to choose their own design
And color schemes to suit their own
Though differing from mine.

Yes and each door has its own design
To suit the owners state of mind
And those who'd want them all the same
Don't understand, the human game.

May father's mansion's many rooms
Have room for all of His children
If we do but share in His love
And see that all are free.

The choice is ours to share this earth
With all its many joys abound
Or to continue as we have
And burn God's mansion down.",7
"My name is Lisa Kalvelage, I was born in Nuremberg
And when the trials were held there nineteen years ago
It seemed to me ridiculous to hold a nation all to blame
For the horrors that the world did undergo
A short while later when I applied to be a G. I. bride
An American consular official questioned me
He refused my exit permit, said my answers did not show
I'd learned my lesson about responsibility.

Thus suddenly I was forced to start thinking on this theme
And when later I was permitted to emigrate
I must have been asked a hundred times where I was and what I did
In those years when Hitler ruled our state
I said I was a child or at most a teen-ager
But that only extended the questioning
They'd ask, where were my parents, my father, my mother
And to this I could answer not a thing.

The seed planted there at Nuremberg in 1947
Started to sprout and to grow
Gradually I understood what that verdict meant to me
When there are crimes that I can see and I can know
And now I also know what it is to be charged with mass guilt
Once in a lifetime is enough for me
No, I could not take it for a second time
And that is why I am here today.

The events of May 25th, the day of our protest,
Put a small balance weight on the other side
Hopefully, someday my contribution to peace
Will help just a bit to turn the tide
And perhaps I can tell my children six
And later on their own children
That at least in the future they need not be silent
When they are asked, ""Where was your mother, when?""",5
"I think of Andy in the cold wet clay
Those three are on my mind
With his comrades down beside him
On that brutal day
Those three are on my mind

There lays young James in his mortal pain
Those three are on my mind
So I ask the killers can you see those three again
Those three are on my mind

I see dark eyed Michael
With his dark eyed bride
Those three are on my mind
And three proud mothers
Weeping side by side
Those three are on my mind

But I'm grieving yet
And for some the sky is bright
I cannot give up hoping
For a morning light
So I ask the killers do you sleep at night
Those three are on my mind

I see tin roof shanties
Where my brothers live
Those three are on my mind
And the little burnt out churches
Where they sing we forgive
Those three are on my mind

I know of Tom Paine's Water Tree
I know the price of liberty
Now I ask the question that is deep inside of me
Did they also burn the courthouse
When they killed those three
Those three are on my mind
Those three are on my mind
Those three are on my mind",5
"It was back in nineteen forty-two,
I was a member of a good platoon.
We were on maneuvers in-a Louisiana,
One night by the light of the moon.
The captain told us to ford a river,
That's how it all begun.
We were -- knee deep in the Big Muddy,
But the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, are you sure,
This is the best way back to the base?""
""Sergeant, go on! I forded this river
'Bout a mile above this place.
It'll be a little soggy but just keep slogging.
We'll soon be on dry ground.""
We were, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, ""Sir, with all this equipment
No man will be able to swim.""
""Sergeant, don't be a Nervous Nellie,""
The Captain said to him.
""All we need is a little determination;
Men, follow me, I'll lead on.""
We were, neck deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

All at once, the moon clouded over,
We heard a gurgling cry.
A few seconds later, the captain's helmet
Was all that floated by.
The Sergeant said, ""Turn around men!
I'm in charge from now on.""
And we just made it out of the Big Muddy
With the captain dead and gone.

We stripped and dived and found his body
Stuck in the old quicksand.
I guess he didn't know that the water was deeper
Than the place he'd once before been.
Another stream had joined the Big Muddy
'Bout a half mile from where we'd gone.
We were lucky to escape from the Big Muddy
When the big fool said to push on.

Well, I'm not going to point any moral,
I'll leave that for yourself
Maybe you're still walking, you're still talking
You'd like to keep your health.
But every time I read the papers
That old feeling comes on;
We're, waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.

Waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.
Waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.
Waist deep! Neck deep! Soon even a
Tall man'll be over his head, we're
Waist deep in the Big Muddy!
And the big fool says to push on!",5

"o to sleep you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Can't you hear the steel rail humming
That's a hobo's lullaby

Do not think about tomorrow
Let tomorrow come and go
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
Safe from all the wind and snow

I know the police cause you trouble
They cause trouble everywhere
But when you die and go to heaven
You won't find no policemen there

I know your clothes are torn and ragged
And your hair is turning grey
Lift your head and smile at trouble
You'll find happiness some day

So go to sleep you weary hobo
Let the towns drift slowly by
Don't you feel the steel rail humming
That's a hobo's lullaby",6

Last train to Nuremberg!
Last train to Nuremberg!
Last train to Nuremberg!

Do I see General Koster and all his crew?
Do I see President Nixon?
Do I see both houses of Congress?
Do I see the voters, me and you?

Who held the rifle? Who gave the orders?
Who planned the campaign to lay waste the land?
Who manufactured the bullet? Who paid the taxes?
Tell me, is that blood upon my hands?

If five hundred thousand mothers went to Washington
And said, ""Bring all of our boys home without delay!""
Would the man they came to see, say he was too busy?
Would he say he had to watch a football game?",5
"Old devil time, I'm gonna fool you now
Old devil time, you'd like to bring me down
When I feel low, my lovers gather round
And help me rise to fight you one more time

Old devil pain, you've often pinned me down
You thought I'd cry and beg you for the end
At that very time my lovers gathered round
And helped me rise to fight you one more time

Old devil fear, you with your icy hands
Old devil fear, you'd like to freeze me cold
When I'm afraid, my lovers gather round
And help me rise to fight you one more time

Old devil hate, I knew you long ago
Before I learned the poison in your breath
Now when I hear your lies my lovers gather round
And help me rise to fight you one more time

No storm nor fire can ever beat us down
No wind that blows but carries us further on
And you who fear, oh lovers gather round
And we will rise to sing it one more time",5
"Words and music by Pete Seeger

Sailng down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

Sun and water, old life givers
L'll have them where ere I roam
And I was not far from home

Sunlight glancing on the water
Life and death are all my own
Yet I was never alone

Life for all my sons and daughters
Golden sparkles in the foam
And I was not far from home

Sailing down this winding highway
Travelers from near and far
And I was never alone

Exploring all the little byways
Sighting all the distant stars
And I was not far from home

Sailing down my golden river
Sun and water all my own
Yet I was never alone

Sun and water, old life givers
L'll have them where ere I roam
And I was not far from home

Yet I was never alone
And I was not far from home

"Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling,
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying.

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen.

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow.

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her,
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar.

They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar.",6
"Oh what can you give me?
Say the sad bells of Rhymney
Is there hope for the future?
Cry the brown bells of Merthyr
Who made the mine owner?
Say the black bells of Rhonda
And who robbed the miner?
Cry the grim bells of Blaina

They will plunder willy-nilly,
Cry the bells of Caerphilly
They have fangs, they have teeth,
Say the loud bells of Neathe
Even God is uneasy,
Say the moist bells of Swansea
They will plunder willy-nilly,
Say the bells of Caerphilly

Put the vandals in court,
Say the bells of Newport
All would be well if, if, if,
Cry the green bells of Cardiff
Why so worried, sisters, why?
Sang the silver bells of Wye
And what will you give me?
Say the sad bells of Rhymney",3
"Bows and flows of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I could have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's clouds illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave them laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's loves illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all.

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say I love you, right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way.

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all",6
"Have you heard of a ship called the good Reuben James
Manned by hard fighting men both of honor and fame?
She flew the Stars and Stripes of the land of the free
But tonight she's in her grave at the bottom of the sea.

Tell me what were their names, tell me what were their names,
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
What were their names, tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James

Well, a hundred men went down in that dark watery grave
When that good ship went down only forty-four were saved.
'Twas the last day of October we saved the forty-four
From the cold ocean waters and the cold icy shore.

It was there in the dark of that uncertain night
That we watched for the U-boats and waited for a fight.
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion roared
And they laid the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor.

Now tonight there are lights in our country so bright
In the farms and in the cities they're telling of the fight.
And now our mighty battleships will steam the bounding main
And remember the name of that good Reuben James.",6

Alive as you and me.

And smiling with his eyes.

Went on to organize,
Went on to organize""

From San Diego up to Maine,
In every mine and mill,
Where working men defend their rights,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill,
It's there you'll find Joe Hill!

Alive as you and me.

"Inch by inch, row by row
Gonna make this garden grow
Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Inch by inch, row by row
Please bless these seeds I sow
Please keep them safe below
'Til the rain comes tumbling down

Pullin' weeds and pickin' stones
We are made of dreams and bones
Need a place to call my own
'Cause the time is close at hand

Grain for grain, sun and rain
Find my way in nature's chain
Till my body and my brain
Tell the music of the land

Inch by inch, row by row

Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Plant your rows straight and long
Season with a prayer and song
Mother Earth will make you strong
If you give her loving care

Inch by inch, row by row
Gonna make this garden grow
Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

Slug by slug, weed by weed
Boy this garden's got me t'd
All the insects come to feed
On my tomato plants

Sunburt face, skined up knees
The kitchen's chocked with zucchinis
I'm shopping at the A&P's
Next time I get the chance

Old crow watching from a tree
He's got his hungry eye on me
In my garden I'm as free
As that feathered thief up there

Inch by inch, row by row
Gonna make this garden grow
Gonna mulch it deep and low
Gonna make it fertile ground

"Come and listen to my story, come and listen to my song. 
I'll tell you of a hero, he's now dead and gone
He was the bravest union boy that I have ever seen
Expecting to be shot on site, or taken for a ride 
By them dirty coal operators

Gave his life in struggle
That was all that he could do 
He died for the union, 
Also for me and you.",3
"First you get the buckets ready, clean the pans and gather firewood,
Late in the winter, it's maple syrup time.
You need warm and sunny days but still a cold and freezing nighttime
For just a few weeks, maple syrup time.
We boil and boil and boil and boil it all day long,
Till ninety seven percent of water evaporates just like this song
And when what is left is syrupy don't leave it too long
Watch out for burning! Maple syrup time.

I know it's not the quickest system but each year I can't resist it.
Get out the buckets, and tap the trees in time
Making it is half the fun, and satisfaction when it's done.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.
My grandpa says perhaps it's just a waste of time.
Ah! but no more than this attempt to make a happy little rhyme,
So pat your feet or swing your tail, but keep in good time.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.

I'll send this song around the world with love to every boy and girl,
Hoping they don't mind a little advice in rhyme.
As in life or revolution, rarely is there a quick solution,
Anything worthwhile takes a little time.
We boil and boil and boil and boil it all day long.
When what is left is syrupy, don't leave it on the flame too long.
But seize the minute, build a new world, sing an old song.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time",6
"Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

And grace my fears relieved
Oh how precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Shall I be wafted to the skies
On flowery beds of ease
While others strive to win the prize
And sail on bloody seas

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see",6

"John Henry was about three days old,
Sittin' on his papa's knee.

Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.
Hammer's gonna be the death of me.""
The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""

""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,

I'd dies with a hammer in my hand.""

""Shaker, why don't you sing?
I'm throwin' thirty pounds from my hips on
Down.
Just listen to that cold steel ring. Lord, Lord.
Listen to that cold steel ring.""

Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor
Heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord,
Lord.
He laid down his hammer and he died.
John Henry had a little woman.
Her name was Polly Ann.

Polly Ann drove steel like a man. Lord,

Prepare animals for slaughter,
Sacrifice our sons and daughters,

When my Lord gives me the warning,
That the solar age is dawning,
And it's good enough for me",6
"The water is wide, I cannot cross over,
And neither have I wings to fly,
Give me a boat that can carry two,
And both shall row, my love and I.

A ship there was, and she sails the sea,
She's loaded deep as deep can be,
But not so deep as the love I'm in,
And I know not how, I sink or swim.

I leaned my back up against some young oak,
Thinking he was a trusty tree,
But first he bended and then he broke,
And thus did my false love to me.

I put my hand into some soft bush,
Thinking the sweetest flower to find.
I pricked my finger to the bone,
And left the sweetest flower alone.

Oh, love is handsome, love is fine,
Gay as a jewel, when first it is new,
But love grows old, and waxes cold,
And fades away, like summer dew.

The seagulls wheel, they turn and dive,
The mountain stands beside the sea.
This world we know turns round and round,
And all for them - and you and me.",6
"Please don't talk about me when I'm gone
Honey, though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything uptight
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Give a little kiss and hope that it brings
Lots of love to you
Makes no difference how Jerry carries on (but I'll make it, baby!)
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone

Please don't talk about me, honey, when I'm gone
Though our friendship ceases from now on
And if you can't say anything real nice
You better not talk at all, is Jerry's advice

We're parting, you'll go your way, I'll go mine
I have just this to do
Here's a little kiss, I hope it brings
Lots and lots of love to you
Makes no difference how I carry on
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me
Please don't talk about me, honey
Please don't talk about me when I'm gone",7
"Chorus:
All my life's a circle
Sunrise and sundown
Moon rolls through the nighttime
Till daybreak comes around
All my life's a circle
Still I wonder why
Seasons spinning 'round again
Years keep rolling by

Seems like I've been here before
Can't remember when
I got this funny feeling
We'll all be together again
No straight lines make up my life
All my roads have bends
No clear cut beginnings
So far no dead ends

Chorus

I've met you a thousand times
I guess you've done the same
Then we lose each other
It's like a children's game
But now I find you here again
The thought comes to my mind
Our love is like a circle
Let's go 'round one more time

Chorus

"My life flows on in endless song
Above earth's lamentation.
I hear the real, thought far off hymn
That hails the new creation
Above the tumult and the strife,
I hear the music ringing;
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?

What through the tempest loudly roars,
I hear the truth, it live'th.
What through the darkness round me close,
Songs in the night it give'th.
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of Heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,
And hear their death-knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near,
How can I keep from singing?

In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging.
When friends by shame are undefiled,
How can I keep from singing?",5
"If I should die before I wake,
All my bone and sinew take
Put me in the compost pile
To decompose me for a while.

Worms, water, sun will have their way,
Returning me to common clay
All that I am will feed the trees
And little fishes in the seas.

When radishes and corn you munch,
You may be having me for lunch
And then excrete me with a grin,
Chortling, ""There goes Lee again.""

'Twill be my happiest destiny
To die and live eternally.

"Words and music by Arlo Guthrie

Looked into your eyes this morning
You were far away
You must have known I was looking for you
You knew you couldn't stay
All these winds blowin' on me
Blowing in the nighttime lonely
Blew on over the ocean to you
Blew my words away

Put on your heavenly shoes babe
Walk around the clouds
You know that's where I'm bound to be now
I'm coming with the crowds
All these faces looking at me
Looking through me I don't mind
I just seen your face a-worrying
I loved you when you cried

Take my hand across the water
You won't leave no tracks behind
Step all over the moon lit ocean
It's only in your mind
All these thoughts just rip me
Who can heal a heart that's broken
Like the winds that blow unspoken
Blow my love away

"Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
Oh, how precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

Shall I be wafted to the skies
On flowery beds of ease
While others strive to win the prize
And sail on bloody seas

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

"I was standing by my window,
On one cold and cloudy day
When I saw that hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I said to that undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this lady you are carrying
Lord, I hate to see here go
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
I went back home, my home was lonesome
Missed my mother, she was gone
All of my brothers, sisters crying
What a home so sad and lone
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
We sang the songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that Mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky",5
"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",5
"There once was a union maid, she never was afraid
Of goons and ginks and company finks and the deputy sheriffs who made the raid.
She went to the union hall when a meeting it was called,
And when the Legion boys come 'round
She always stood her ground.

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union, I'm sticking to the union.
Oh, you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union,
I'm sticking to the union 'til the day I die.

This union maid was wise to the tricks of company spies,
She couldn't be fooled by a company stool, she'd always organize the guys.
She always got her way when she struck for better pay.
She'd show her card to the National Guard
And this is what she'd say

You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me;
Get you a man who's a union man and join the ladies' auxiliary.
Married life ain't hard when you got a union card,
A union man has a happy life when he's got a union wife.

"John Hardy was a desperate little man,
He carried two guns ev'ry day.
He shot down a man on that West Virginia line,

So drunk that he could not see.
And a man walked up and took him by the arm,

Poor boy, Johnny, come and walk along with me.""
John Hardy stood in his old jail cell,
The tears running down from his eyes.
He said, ""I've been the death of many a poor boy.
But my six-shooters never told a lie,

Was a little girl dressed in blue.

She said, ""Johnny, I've been true to you.
God knows, Johnny, I've been true to you.""

Was a little girl dressed in red.

"My Father's mansion's many rooms
Have room for all of His children
As long as we do share His love
And see that all are free

And see that all are free to grow
And see that all are free to know
And free to open or to close
The door of their own room

What is a room without a door
Which sometimes locks or stands ajar?
What is a room without a wall
To keep out sight and sound from all?

And dwellers in each room should have
The right to choose their own design
And color schemes to suit their own
Though differing from mine

Yes and each door has its own design
To suit the owners state of mind
And those who'd want them all the same
Don't understand the human game

My Father's mansion's many rooms
Have room for all of His children
If we do but share in His love
And see that all are free

With all its many joys abound
Or to continue as we have
And burn God's mansion down",7

Children of all the earth

Won't you show my brothers and sisters
My rainbow design
'Cause I I would bind up this sorry world
With hand and my heart and mind
Oh hand and heart and mind

Oh had I a golden thread
And a needle so fine
I I would weave a magic spell
Of rainbow design

And it's this thought keeps me moving on
If we could heed these early warnings
The time is now quite early morning
If we could heed these early warnings
The time is now quite early morning

Some say that humankind won't long endure
But what makes them so doggone sure?
I know that you who hear my singing
Could make those freedom bells go ringing
I know that you who hear my singing
Could make those freedom bells go ringing

And so keep on while we live
Until we have no, no more to give
And when these fingers can strum no longer
Hand the old banjo to young ones stronger
And when these fingers can strum no longer
Hand the old banjo to young ones stronger

So though it's darkest before the dawn
These thoughts keep us moving on
Through all this world of joy and sorrow
We still can have singing tomorrows
Through all this world of joy and sorrow
We still can have singing tomorrows",6

To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'
No chair.

People said to the father, ""You get out
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and
Your son!"" The boy and his father were
Ostracized. That means they made them
Live on the edge of town.

Now in this town they used to tell stories.
The old people used to tell stories about
The giants that lived in the old days They
Used to tell a story about a giant called
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a
House and could eat, people, up.
Of course, nobody believed it, but they
Told the story anyway.

One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red
Over the hill. And the first people got up
And looked out of their window, they saw a
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And
They could feel the whole ground shake.
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""

He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""

The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He
Grabs his father by one hand. The father
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the
Ukelele. They run across the field. People
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.

Well, you know the giant had never heard a song
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.

They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:

Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo
(Oh, you sing it with me,)",6
"The words mean, I am a truthful man
From the land of the palm trees
And before dying, I want to share the poems of my soul 
My poems are soft green, 
My poems are also flaming crimson
My poems are like a wounded fawn 
Seeking refuge in the forest 
The last verse says ""con los pobres de la tierra"" 
With the poor people of this earth
I want to share my fate
The streams of the mountain
Pleases me more than the sea",5

If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning 
I'd ring it in the evening, all over this land 
I'd ring it in danger, I'd ring out a warning 
I'd ring in love between my brothers and my sisters all over this land 
If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning

"One day, one day, Sir
I was walking along
I heard that special
Singing a lonesome song

Oh, let the Midnight Special
Shine her light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine her ever lovin light on me

If you ever go to Houston
You know you better walk right
You know you better not stagger
You know you better not fight
Because the sheriff will just arrest you
You know he'll carry you down
And you can bet your bottom dollar
Oh Lord, you're penitentiary bound

[Chorus]
Yonder come little Rosie
How in the world do you know?
I can tell her by her apron
And the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand
Goes a marchin to the Captain
Says I want my man

[Chorus]
Now here comes jumpin' Judy
I'll tell you how I know
You know, Judy brought jumpin'
To the whole wide world
She brought it in the morning
Just about the break of day
You know, if I ever get to jumpin'
Oh Lord, I'll up and jump away.

"When something in my history is found
Which contradicts the views that I propound
Or shows that I perhaps am not the guy I claim to be
Here's what I usually do

[Chorus]
I lie
I simply boldly falsify
I look the other feller in the eye
And just deny, deny, deny
I lie

I don t apologize. Not me. Instead
I say I never said the things I said
Nor did the things some people saw me do
When confronted by some things they know are true

[Chorus]

I hate those weasel words some slickies use
To blur their past or muddy up their views
Not me. I'm blunt. One thing that makes me great
Is that I'll never dodge nor obfuscate

Long time passing.
Where have all the flowers gone?
Long time ago.

Young girls
They've taken husbands every one.

Young men
They're all in uniform.

Soldiers
They've gone to graveyards every one.

Graveyards
They're covered with flowers every one.

Flowers
Young girls have picked them every one.",5
"Did you ever hear the story of Aimee McPherson?
Aimee McPherson, that wonderful person,
She weight a hundred eighty and her hair was red
And preached a wicked sermon, so the papers said.

[Chorus]
Hi dee hi dee hi dee hi
Ho dee ho dee ho dee ho.

Aimee built herself a radio station
To broadcast her preaching to the nation.
She found a man named Armistead who knew enough
To run the radio while Aimee did her stuff.

She held a camp meeting out at Ocean Park
Preached from early morning 'til after dark.
Said the benediction, folded up her tent,
And nobody knew where Aimee went.

When Aimee McPherson got back from this journey,
She told her tale to the district attorney.
Said she'd been kidnapped on a lonely trail.
In spite of all the questions, she stuck to her tale.

Well, the Grand Jury started an investigation,
Uncovered a lot of spicy information.
Found out about a love nest down at Carmel-by-the-Sea,
Where the liquor was expensive and the loving was free.

They found a cottage with a breakfast nook,
A folding bed with a worn-out look.
The slats were busted and the springs were loose,
And the dents in the mattress fitted Aimee's caboose.

Well they took poor Aimee and they threw her in jail.
Last I heard she was out on bail.
They'll send her up for a stretch, I guess,
She worked herself up into an awful mess

Now Radio Ray is a going hound;
He's going yet and he ain't been found.
They got his description, but they got it too late.
Sin they got it, he's lost a lot of weight.

Now I'll end my story in the usual way,
About this lady preacher's holiday.
If you don't get the moral then you're the gal for me
'Cause they got a lot of cottages down at Carmel-by-the-Sea.",5

Or single footing somewhere below?

Eight lovers they say combed your waving black hair
Eight men knew the feel of your dark velvet waist
Eight men heard the sounds of your tan leather skirt
Eight men heard the bark of the guns that you wore

Cole Younger was your first and the father of your girl
And the name that you picked for your daughter was Pearl
Cole robbed a bank and he drawed the life line
But I heard he was pardoned after twenty years time

Your Cherokee lover, Blue Duck was his name
He loved you in the sand hills before your great fame
I heard he stopped a bullet in 1885
And your Blue Duck's no longer alive

You took Jim Reed to your warm wedding bed
And from out of your love was born the boy, Ed
A pal killed Jim Reed by the dark of the moon
And your son Ed was blowed down in a drunken saloon

Then there was Bob Younger, you loved him so well
He rode with the James Boys out on the long trail
Well, they caught him in Minnesota along with the gang
And he died down in jail in the cell or the chain

You loved Mr. William Clarke Quantrill
And his Civil War guerrillas in the Missouri hills
He hit Lawrence, Kansas and fought them still
And when he rode out, two hundred lay killed

They say you could have, they whispered you might
Have loved Frank James on a couple of nights
He fought the Midland Railroad almost to death
Then in 1915 Frank drawed his last breath

They say it could be, they say maybe so
That you loved Jesse James, that desperado
Jesse got married, had a wife and a son
Was shot down at home by the Ford brothers' guns

"As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay

I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die

It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle I used to go gay
First down to Rosie's and then to the card house
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today

Get sixteen gamblers to carry my coffin
Get six jolly cowboys to sing me a song
Take me to the graveyard and lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song
Take me to the valley and lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy, I know I've done wrong

Oh beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Play the Dead March as they carry me along
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin
Put roses to deaden the clods as they fall

As I walked out in the streets of Laredo
As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay",5

"I'm just a typical American from a typical American town
I believe in God and Senator Todd and a-keeping old Castro down
And when it came my time to serve I knew ""better dead than red""
But when I got to my old draft board, buddy, this is what I said:

[Chorus:]
Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, my feet are flat and my asthma's getting worse
Oh I think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm goin' to school
And I'm working in a defense plant

I got a dislocated disc and a wracked up back
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs
And when bombshells hit, I get epileptic fits
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs
I got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes
I can hardly touch my knees
And if the enemy came close to me
I'd probably start to sneeze

[Chorus]

I hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies,
But one thing you gotta see
That someone's gotta go over there
But that someone isn't me
So I wish you well, Sarge, give 'em Hell
Yeah kill me a thousand or more
And if you ever get a war without blood and gore
Well I'll be the first to go

"[Chorus] 
How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been.

Old age is golden so I've heard said
But sometimes I wonder as I crawl into bed
With my ears in a drawer, my teeth in a cup
My eyes on the table until I wake up.
As sleep dims my vision I say to myself:
Is there anything else I should lay on the shelf?
But though nations are warring and business is vexed
I'll stick around to see what happens next.

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been.

When I was young my slippers were red,
I could kick up my heels right over my head.
When I was older my slippers were blue,
But still I could dance the whole night thru.
Now I am older my slippers are black,
I huff to the store and I puff my way back.
But never you laugh; I don't mind at all,
I'd rather be huffing than not puff at all.

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been.

I get up each morning and dust off my wits
Open the paper and read the obits
If I'm not there I know I'm not dead
So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed.

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been.",6

"If you'll gather 'round me, children,
A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen.

And as through your life you travel,
Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.",5
"When Great Grandfather was a gay young man
And Great Grandmother was his bride
They found a lot, a jolly little spot
Over on the old North Side
It sloped down toward the river, from River Avenue
Great Grandma said that it would give her
Such a lovely view
So they took a look in Godey's Ladies Book
To see what they could find
And they found a house, a jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Great Grandfather was a handy man
Who never wasted any time
He found a crew that knew just what to do
With white pine, common brick, and lime.
He said, ""I'll build a big veranda, where Amanda can perch.
""And I'll sit there myself on Sunday mornings
""When everybody else has gone to church.""
The neighbors said, ""He's crazy in the head
""He's surely lost his mind.""
But he built that house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Great Grandpa at last was laid to rest
With Great Grandmother at his side.
Old Aunt Amanda said, ""My land, an
""Empty house I can't abide.
""I'll start a ladies' seminary, it will be very select.
""Of course, it will be very necessary
""That all my girls be circumspect.""
As you may guess, it was a big success
Those girls were so refined
In that self-same house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Aunt Amanda's work at last was done
And she passed on to her reward.
Appeared a sign that bore the line
Announcing simply, ""Room and Board.""
The house was soon filled with roomers, of every degree
Red flannel underwear and bloomers
Hung out for everyone to see.
The old porch stoop had started in to droop
The house looked so resigned
That self-same house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now that old house was looking worse and worse
And so was River Avenue.
Wooden shacks across the tracks
Spoiled Great Grandma's lovely view.
A group of very pretty ladies moved in there one day.
The were such pretty Sues and Sadies
But a wagon came and took them all away.
Said one old dame, ""Now isn't it a shame
""My girls were so refined.""
But they closed that house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.",5

I learned that murderers die for their crimes
Even if we make a mistake sometimes.

What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?

What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?
I learned our Government must be strong;
It's always right and never wrong;
Our leaders are the finest men
And we elect them again and again.

What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?

What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?
I learned that war is not so bad;
I learned about the great ones we have had;
We fought in Germany and in France
And someday I might get my chance.

What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school today,
Dear little boy of mine?",5
"The Missouri, she's a might river
Away you rolling river
The red man's camp lies on her borders
Away, we're bound away across the wide
Missouri

A white man loved an Indian maiden
Away you rolling river
With notions sweet his canoe was laden
Away, we're bound away across the wide
Missouri

O Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Away you rolling river
I'll take her 'cross the rolling water
Away, we're bound away across the wide
Missouri

The chief disdained the trader's dollars
Away you rolling river
My daughter never you shall follow
Away, we're bound away across the wide
Missouri

At last there came a Yankee skipper
Away you rolling river
He winked his eye, and he tipped his flipper
Away, we're bound away across the wide
Missouri

He sold the chief that fire-water
Away you rolling river
And 'cross the river he stole his daughter
Away, we're bound away across the wide
Missouri

O Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Away you rolling river
Across the wide and rolling water

"You know this language that we speak,
Is part German, Latin and part Greek
Celtic and Arabic all in a heap,
Well amended by the people in the street
Choctaw gave us the word ""okay"";
""Vamose"" is a word from Mexico way.
And all of this is a hint I suspect of what comes next.

[Chorus]
I think that this whole world
Soon mama my whole wide world
Soon mama my whole world
Soon gonna be gettin' mixed up.
Soon mama my whole world
Soon mama my whole wide world
Soon mama my whole world
Soon gonna be gettin' mixed up.

I like Polish sausage, I like Spanish rice,
And pizza pie is also nice
Corn and beans from the Indians here
Washed down by German beer
Marco Polo traveled by camel and pony,
He brought to Italy, the first macaroni
And you and I as well as we're able,
We put it all on the table

[Chorus]

There were no red-headed Irishmen
Before the Vikings landed in Ireland
How many Romans had dark curly hair
Before they brought slaves from Africa?
No race of man is completely pure,
Nor is anyone's mind, that's for sure
The winds mix the dust of every land,
And so will woman and man.

[Chorus]

This doesn't mean we will all be the same,
We'll have different faces and different names
Long live many different kinds of races
It's difference of opinion that makes horse races
Just remember the rule about rules, brother
What could be right for one could be wrong for the other
And take a tip from La Belle France: ""Viva la difference!""

[Chorus]",6

"Of time and rivers flowing
The seasons make a song
And we who live beside her
Still try to sing along
Of rivers, fish, and men
And the season still a-coming
When she'll run clear again.

So many homeless sailors,
So many winds that blow
I asked the half blind scholars
Which way the currents flow
So cast your nets below
And the gods of moving waters
Will tell us all they know.

The circles of the planets
The circles of the moon
The circles of the atoms
All play a marching tune
And we who would join in
Can stand aside no longer
Not let us all begin.",5

Flowing to some mighty ocean,

Seek to bar it from its way.
But relentlessly this river
Seeks its brothers in the sea.
But relentlessly this river
Seeks its brothers in the sea.

You will find us in the mainstream,
Steering surely through the foam,
Far beyond the raging waters
We can see our certain home.
Far beyond the raging waters
We can see our certain home.

For we have mapped this river
And we know its mighty force
And the courage that this gives us
Will hold us to our course.
And the courage that this gives us

Together we must go,
Hasten onward to that meeting
Where my brothers wait I know.

Unfolds a plan of her devising,
A thin premeditated rig
To use in rising.

And all that journey down through space,
In cool descent and loyal hearted,
She spins a ladder to the place
From where she started.

Thus I, gone forth as spiders do
In spider's web a truth discerning,
Attach one silken thread to you
For my returning.",5

And to my old blue sky

Watch well you keep it strong,
As long as sun will shine.

Keep pure and sweet and green,

Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day

Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon",5

Spain brought the guitar to Mexico 400 years ago
U.S.A. picked a quarrel with Mexico and got Texas and California
And it also got the guitar and the guitar got us

It was Afro American people in the south
That worked out this way of playing it though
You know in Europe they usually play a guitar
But the Afro American peple worked out a way to play it
Just like a drum band

The base strings were played by a thumb with a steady beat
And the top strings were played
With the finger and got all the little off beats
Up in Syracuse there's a 92 year old woman
Who wrote a song, which some of you may know
She plays it, who knows it?

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast

So I can hear old number nine
As she goes roaring by

"Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling,
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying.

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen.

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow.

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her,
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar.

They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar.",6
"[Chorus]
This land is your land,
This land is my land,
From California to the New York Island,
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters,
This land was made for you and me.

As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway,
I saw below me that golden valley,
This land was made for you and me.

I roamed and I rambled, and I followed my footsteps
To the sparking sands of her diamond deserts,
All around me a voice was sounding,
This land was made for you and me.

When the sun came shining, then I was strolling,
And the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling,
A voice was chanting as the fog was lifting,
This land was made for you and me.

One bright sunny morning, in the shadow of the steeple,
By the relief office I saw my people,
As they stood there hungry, I stood there wondering if,
This land was made for you and me.

Was a big high wall there that tried to stop me,
Was a great big sign that said, ""Private Property,""
But on the other side, it didn't say nothing,
That side was made for you and me.

Nobody living can ever stop me,
As I go walking my freedom highway,
Nobody living can make me turn back,
This land was made for you and me.

Maybe you've been working as hard as you're able,
But you've just got crumbs from the rich man's table,
And maybe you're thinking, was it truth or fable,
That this land was made for you and me.

Woodland and grassland and river shoreline,
To everything living, even little microbes,
Fin, fur, and feather, we're all here together,
This land was made for you and me.

This land is your land, but it once was my land,
Until we sold you Manhattan Island.
You pushed our Nations to the reservations,
This land was stole by you from me",6

"Well they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia,
Said: ""Steve, you're way behind time,
""This is not 38, this is Ol' 97,
""Put her into Spencer on time.""

Then he turned around and said to his black, greasy fireman,
""Shovel on a little more coal.
""And when we cross that White Oak mountain,
""Watch Ol' '97 roll.""

And then a telegram come from Washington station,
This is how it read:
""Oh that brave engineer that run ol 97,
""Is lyin in old Danville dead.""

'Cos he was going down a grade making 90 miles an hour,
The whistle broke into a scream.
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle,
Scalded to death by the steam.

One more time!

Oh, now all you ladies you'd better take a warning,
From this time on and learn.
Never speak hard words to your true-lovin' husband.
He may leave you and never return.

We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile.
For they say you are taking the sunshine.
That has brightened our pathways awhile.

Come and sit by my side, if you love me.
Do not hasten to bid me adieu.
Just remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true.

O how lonely, how sad I will be.
O think of the found heart you're breaking

To jump into the river and drown.

I asked your mother for you,
She told me you was too young.
I wish to God I'd never seen your face,
I'm sorry you ever was born.

You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn,
You caused me to leave my home.

Was please sing me one more song.",6

Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth

Now I've seen it slip away and tomorrow's just another day
To find relief from feeling sad

There's no reason why

You said goodbye

What else can I do
Maybe I don't know right from wrong
Who knows who cares now
What else can I do

Yesterday I kept wishing that
You had changed your mind
Now I guess that it's
All up to you
Am I just today another one
That you've left behind
Or did you love me
With a love so true

I thought you and I were friends
Still you made me cry
What else can I do
'N' maybe love will find a way
Give me one more try
It's all up to you

How can you tell me that I must be dreaming
You're waiting around I've got nothing to do
So tired of waiting I've only one lifetime

Sorting out my thoughts
But I don't know which are the right ones to keep
Thinking of the countries
Where there's nothing left to eat
Counting the starving millions by the thousand

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Well once I was a sword, many years ago
And my blade was broad, many years ago
Wore it with pride, and into battle I'd ride, on a warrior side
And cut my tail, their was loss of my tail
And soon did rust, corrode to dust, oh my

Well once I was a daisy, many years ago
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago

And forgetting to float he sunk like a lead and stayed until dead

And I lived among that mud , many years ago

That was it with a prune, and when the good Lord was done
I walked with the sun, I shed my skins
And tried my wings and flew away

Well, once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival
And once I was a carp and lived in waters on the meadow
And once I was a mynah bird, quoting verses from the Bible
I said pretty boy, pretty boy, Saint Luke

Well once I was a mule, many years ago
And my master treat me cruel, many years ago
By by was sick, so I moved to a kick, 
So I took out a stick , laid it back across my back
To an almighty crack to my dismay
I cast away into the blue

Then I was born a human baby, many years ago
I remember I was born unto a lady, many years ago

Who turned out to be wild, sent the devil a prayer
Caused the parson to swear so I took my leave
To lie and thieve, on my way to jail

Well, I've been a tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor

And your baby cries out to sea

"Johnny boy, he's always propping up the bar
He's sees life crystallized through his jar
He says he only lives for beer

Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang onto

Sally seems to get bigger everyday
She evens out in a contented way
A finger on the pulse of every guy
But deep in the night you can hear her cry

Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a life that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
Oh please a heart to hang onto

Give me heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto

Danny, he wants to save for a new guitar
He's going to learn to play but he won't get far
He thinks it's an easy going' high
But his whole life is just another try

Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a suit that's tailored true
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang onto

I need a heart... to hang onto...",6
"River's getting higher
No wood for the fire
They saw the messiah
But I guess I missed him again
That brings my score to a hundred and ten

The water's getting closer
Better ring up the grocer
Stack up the potatoes
Oh, Jack are you ever coming back
Will your operatic soul turn black?

Keep me turning, oh keep me
Keep me burning, for your sun
Keep me turning
Don't you leave me till the very last

Keep me turning, I'm hanging on
Stop me yearning, I've had enough
Keep me turning
While I hand in my backstage pass

Children are smiling
Parents are wining
Bow tie tying
For the big day ahead real soon
Is there really gonna be no room

I've got a ticket
Just gotta get past the picket
They say that the trick is to walk in backwards
Like your walking out
I guess the lord's wearing glasses now

Keep me turning, Oh keep me on
Keep me burning, For your sun
Keep me turning
Don't you leave me till the very last

Keep me turning, I'm hanging on
Stop me yearning, I've had enough
Keep me turning

Want people to cry when I put them down

As he laid me back just like an empty dress
And I moved

His tears his only truth.

Life is useless like Ecclesiastes say
I never had a chance
But opportunity's now in my hands

All I need is a mirror
Then I'm a star
I'm so sick of dud TV
Next time you switch on
You might see me, oh.what a thrill for you

I've been there and gone there
I've lived there and bummed there
I've spun there, I gave there
I drank there and I slaved there

I've had enough of the way things been done
Every man on a razors edge
Someone has used us to kill with the same gun
Killing each other by driving a wedge

My life's a mess I wait for you to pass
I stand here at the bar, I hold an empty glass

Been right around on a golden ring

See a smiling face

Though we all could be mad
That's what they say
We just can't all be bad

I'll work all day but not to pay it out

But all I have to have's a little time with you
A smile sets me reeling
A kiss feel like stealing
Your love is like heroin
This addict is mellowing
I can't pretend that I'm tough

There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place
Life would seem so easy on the other track
But even a hurricane won't turn me back
You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me
I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough

Common sense's tell me not to try'n continue

"I stood at the door beside her
But she wouldn't let me pass
I was such a bore, and I lied to her
I said I didn't really want her ass
I went away in the mud and rain
The gang became snide and laughed
I was slain, but I smiled and the pain
Began to subside at last

And when I got back to my hotel
I wondered if the thunder meant I'd landed in Hell
And on the forecourt I slipped and fell
I cracked my stupid head and I heard a bell
I thought, hey

Somebody saved me - it happened again
Somebody saved me - I thank you, my friend
Somebody saved me from a fate worse than Heaven
'Cause if I'd had her for just an hour
I'd have wanted her forever
Somebody saved me

You would have thought that I'd have learned
Twenty years ago or more
A beautiful girl raised her mouth and yearned
But I didn't know what lips were for
I ran away in the mud and rain
The weather here is never too bright
She'd had an affray with her man and came
For solace and the means to fight

She finally bored with seducing me
And took up with some geezer from the Ealing scene
It nearly killed him like it would've killed me
When her original man snapped his fingers and she obeyed, she obeyed

But somebody saved me - it happened again
Somebody saved me - I thank you, my friend
Somebody saved me from a fate worse than Heaven
'Cause if I'd had her for just an hour
I'd have wanted her forever

I don't know about guardian angels
All I know about's staying alive
I can't shout about spiritual labels
When little ones die and big ones thrive

All I know is that I've been making it
And there've been times that I didn't deserve to
Every show there's been more faking it
But right at the point of no return

Somebody saves me again and again
Somebody saves me - I thank you, my friend
Somebody saves me from a fate worse than Heaven
'Cause if I blew it for a single moment
I'd blow it forever
But somebody saves me

I took up the connection once
Made me feel quite aloof
I never could queue to collect my lunch
While I was pursuing the truth
So I left my folks in the mud and rain
It always rains in Sunnyside Road
I lived hippy jokes, getting stoned insane
Till the rain looked just like snow

But there was a soul in whom I could depend
He worked himself crazy while I laid in bed
I never leaned on a person like I leaned right then
And when I finally woke up clean
My friend was dead, stone dead

Somebody saved me - it happened again
Somebody saved me - I thank you, my friend
Somebody saved me - I ain't ready for Heaven
'Cause if I'd seen you for a second, I'd have wanted to see you forever
Somebody saved me
Somebody saved me",5

Then they wink and snort their line
And say how great their Bentley is
They feel so warm when they confirm

They say that nakedness is what our Lord intended
When we stand naked then we all appear the same
But it's just faking it if we all try pretending
Are we just making all our prayers in the rain
Heaven knows I need new clothes

We are marching as to war
But we are really fighting for
Our uniform, our uniform

When I contemplate my future I go numb, don't feel a thing
I don't overrate my suitors, number one, I always sing
But the state and their computers make me run for comfort
In my uniform, in uniform I feel like a king

They say that nakedness is what our Lord intended
That we stand naked, then we all appear the same
But it's just faking it if we all try pretending
Are we just making all our prayers in the rain

It seems insane
But heaven knows
It's all the same
And I need new clothes

"My cup is cold, my paper's old
My heart is sold to melancholia
My clothes are torn, my shoes are worn
My heart is borne to melancholia

A strange surprise, what I despised
In other guys is her, is me
They lose their girl, they lose their world
Then they cry for all to see

I've never felt so bad
The virus drives me mad

The sheets are gray that fits the day
She went away, I lost all power
The dust is thick, the dog is sick
The kids have picked most all the flowers

The sun is shining but not for me
The sun is shining but not for me

"Did you ever sleep in a bear pit
With apple cores and mice along?
Did you ever lay on ice and grit
Or search for a place where the wind was gone?

Did you ever tramp up endless hills
Past cozy homes with secret beds?
Did you ever dream of a suicide pill
And wake up cold to the smell of bread?

Well I have slept there badly twice
And shared my straw with scratching mice
Although you'll find some deep brown hair
I'll tell you something for nothin'
There ain't no bears in there (cache, cache)
Not a single bear in there (cache, cache)

Did you ever have to make a draw
For a hard wooden bench or a bed of stone?
Did you ever jimmy a stable door
Or scare the horse to escape the snow?

Did you ever invade a neat little yard
Wake up the kids who hope for ghosts?
Did you ever cause their dogs to bark
A guests who cursed their noisy hosts

Don't jump in expectin' fun
Don't swagger in there with your elephant gun
Don't enter the cage wavin' chairs
'Cause I'll tell you something for nothin'
There ain't no bears in there (cache, cache)
There ain't no bears in there (cache, cache)

Did you ever pass the police at work
And hope that they might take you in?
Did you ever wonder why music hurts
When someone plays it aloof to sin?
Did you ever believe that a smile could cure
A happy face keep you warm at night?
Were you ever fooled by laughter's lure
Only to find that they laughed in spite?

Don't jump in expectin' fun
Don't swagger in there with your elephant gun
Don't enter the cage wavin' a chair
'Cause I'll tell you something for nothin'
There ain't no bears in there (cache, cache)
There ain't no bear in there (cache, cache)

Did you ever finally find a place
A soft warm bed in a room of flowers
And when you finally laid down your face
You found you slept for a hundred hours
A hundred hours.

There ain't no bears in there (cache, cache)

Watching ripples splashing over
Wadding the bank where horses are grazing
Reflection shatter quite amazing

But soon I quietly ask, is this the way for me?
I twist my vacuum flask and have a cup of tea

Goin' fishin' never catch none
If I did, I'd surely lance
The spirit of the first is quiggley
The fish tackle scares me and the snails

The pleasure cruiser's speed
Laden with wind cheaters
The hooters blow and seize
My mind from nature's creatures

Blowing the fish, emptying in my warm hand
I want fishin' everlasting

Watch it bob, it cruises pass

Moves 'cross land, but not to fast

Baking as an apple, no shoes on your feet

You look a whole lot better off than you used to do

Hey little boy, throw me the ball

Ain't I met you sometime before
When the old street was here in the grocer's store?

Can I believe what I see with my own eyes?

He used to be my very good friend
Now I recall, in the mystery of things
I've been here before and done a million things

If it's all right with you, I'll remember you too
But I won't tell you who you were last time
But you're making up for it now
I suffer amnesia when you kiss my brow

Lead to darkness, leading home
In the midnight of a soul's unsleeping

Hear the distant noise of traffic stalling
I hear the prostituted children calling

Of a winter's night, without a moon

I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out

I look over chequered fields
And the towering web of steel
Young and old will sit and judge unfeeling
While the empty church's bell are pealing

And the green hills lay ignored, untended
Lonely watchers remain unbefriended
And out in the one way streets
Is a swelling maze, without a door

You will take my place",5

When carried down from stairs

Did you relay care

"Happy Jack wasn't old but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle Of Man
The kids all would sing, he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head on their furry donkey

But they never stopped Jack or the water lapping
And they couldn't distract him from the seagulls flapping
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried and tried and tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied and lied and lied and lied and lied

But they never stopped Jack or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

They never stopped Jack nor the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy

"I went to Dallas back in 82
The cafe society was numero oui
Surrounded by model, girls and guys in boots
I watched as they conspired taking parking lot dues
Looking back on a cherished memory
A strange conception seems to frontal me
Holly's like ivy
She grows on it

I realize if all the beautiful girls
Were lost like gems, will grow to pearls
Now Holly is behind me,
And I fall from the place
I've got this burning sensation
As she brushed my things
Looking back on a cherished memory
A strange conception seems to frontal me
Holly's like ivy
She grows on it

Looking back on a cherished memory
A strange conception seems to frontal me
Holly's like

I know I must hurry back there
And look for Holly with her long brown hair
I was brit by some relief
All I want for Christmas is her two front teeth
Looking back on my cherished memory
A strange conception seems to frontal me
Holly's like ivy
She grows on it
Holly's like ivy

"Down at the Astoria the scene was changing,
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating,
We were the first band to vomit in the bar,
And find the distance to the stage too far,
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock,
Rock is dead they say,
Long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock,
Be it dead or alive.

People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving,
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins,
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong,
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone,
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock,
Rock is dead, they say,
Long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock,
Be it dead or alive.

Landslide, rocks are falling,
Falling down 'round our very heads,
We tried but you were yawning,
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead.

The place is really jumping to the high-watt amps,
'Til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps,
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle,
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles,
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock,
Rock is dead, they say,
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock, be it dead or alive.

She said never ask me, If I love you baby
What do you really think, I'm going to say
You never asked me, If I loved you

Just tell me once, just tell me twice

Does she really love me

I always feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad

He said, ""Son now here's some little something""
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
In fact I, I don't feel bad at all

Pictures of Lily let me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems
Pictures of Lily make me feel alright

And then one day things weren't so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said, ""Son, now don't be silly""

""She's been dead since 1929""
Oh, how I cried that night
If only I'd been born in Lily's time
It would have been alright

Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
But their was always,
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily to help me feel alright
Cause me and Lily are together in my dreams
Hey I was wondering mister, have you ever seen
Pictures of Lily?

"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must've played them all.
But I never seen anything like him
In any amusement hall...
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers,
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard.
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard's got
Such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

He ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see no lights a flashin',
Plays by sense of smell,
Always has a replay,
An' never tilts at all...

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard.

And he just does the rest.

Never seen him fall...

"Sitting in clouds of air
Praying no on is there
Holding your head to the sky, in there
Swinging the smoke around
Cross like in Heaven bound
Hot line is cut up, because your bills all paid

Praying the game you play
Sin is from sin's to say
One minute here again, out of your brain
Playing the praying game
Stay away from them
Keeping out on the reign
Praying the game

And it's all the losers start
As your hurting all together
Are you really getting threw

Would you be wrong to sing and dance
Life goes on forever
Understanding isn't really new

I am a fool you claim
We are one all the same
Then you surrender, and the case is closed

Guess you ride innocence
I cause a sin offense
Short change my heart, for a fashionable home

Praying the game we play
All do it every day
No point pretending nobody's fool
Staying the same we say
Bring on a change our way
Treating the Lord, like a teacher in school

And we check over each shoulder
Making sure that no one knows
As we get down on our knees

And yet the witness inside
Looking out threw our own eyes
Is there really worthy on the trees

Praying the game we play
Saying's from saves to say
One minute here again, and out of your brain
Playing the praying game, staying away from pain
Keeping out of the rain, praying the game",5

And I want my soul
To gush up like fountains
To where you reside",3

Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the sad man
To be the bad man
Behind blue eyes

"Mary, you are everything a man could want,
And I want you, Mary.
Did you know when you pushed me once away from you
The thing I knew grew inside me.

People are dancing for you now,
But I can't see why.
Can't they see that they can't beat
Nothing I have for you.

Mary, you are everything a man could need.
How I need you, Mary.
Yeah.
How I need you.

When I look at the hole in your coat.
I have to love you more.
I remember when I was a child
And my brother slept on the floor.

Oh, I know that the sun don't shine
Down on every man.
But when women let the my brother down.
I swore one day I'd land
Me one Mary
Swore I'd land me one Mary.
Oh, Mary.

When I look at the hole in your coat.
I have to love your more.
I remember when I was a child.
My brother slept on the floor.

Oh, I know that the sun don't shine.

"There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breathe rippling by
The note is eternal
I hear it, it sees me
Forever we blend as forever we die

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

As people a**emble
civilization is trying to find a new way to die
But killing is really merely scene changer
All men are bored with other men's lives

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

Gas on the hillside
 Oil in the tea cup
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness
The note that began all can also destroy

We all know success when we all find our own dream
And our love is enough to knock down any wall
And the future's been seen as men try to realize
The simple secret of the note in us all
In us all

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

Today is the day the sound curdles mountains
Flowing and blowing each man in its wake
Destroying itself in the end with vibration
There's nothing on earth it's challenge can take
Excepting one note

Excepting one note pure and easy
Playing so free like breath rippling by

Excepting one note
Excepting one note
Excepting one note, pure and easy
Excepting one note, pure and easy
(repeated)

There once was a note listen
There once was a note listen
There once was a note listen
There once was a note listen",6
"I'm playing my guitar while my sister bangs the jar
The glass sets up a sound like people laughing
It's going to my brain and it's easing all my pain
I must hear this sound again 'cause time is passing

Mmm.

I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing

Find it, I got to hear it all again...
My heart has heard the sound of harmony
Blind to it, as my tears fall again
It's only by the music I'll be free

There's something in the whisper of the trees
Millions hear it, still they can't believe
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves
As an empire of dead men leave their graves

Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls
Don't listen to me or words from men above
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greed's
Just hear it in the sound of time a passing

Find it, I got to hear it all again
My heart has heard the sound of harmony
Blind to it, as my tears fall again
It's only by the music I'll be free",6
"You are safe from harm on the grid
You are safe from harm

This is the dream that I wake up dreaming
Lovin' my lover under dawn-pink skies
A perfect design that I wake up scheming
What I recall when I first open my eyes

This is the tune that you're always hearing
What you'll remember when you've broken the ties
We're dancing together as the sun is appearing
Again and again you awake in surprise

Early morning dreams
You feel so tender-you feel so wet
You feel so secure so deep in love and yet the feeling is fleeting
You're a fugitive, safe at last
Your heart is beating
Will you relive the recent past?

Early morning dreams come true
I've proved it now that I'm here with you
You are here by my side
I'm siding with you
Early morning dreams come true",6
"I'm an English boy
I was brought up right
Hold me down
And I will bite
I know no fear
I serve with joy
I'm proud to be here
An English boy

I feel like a stray dog
Blurred like a movie
You say you've come to arrest me
But you're just trying to test me
I'm bored with your prejudice
Spreading like a fever
Your promises to train me
Are just attempts to restrain me

Precisely made
Pin me down
I am not afraid
I show no fear
I will serve with joy
I'm proud to be here
An English boy

Use me like a headline
Cut pieces to pieces

Red on the touch-line
Freezing up the future
Stopping every stopwatch
You say we're moving like an oil slick
Thicker than a house brick

I'm an English boy
I was brought up right
If you raise your dress
Then I will bite
My voice is clear
I got perfect poise
Good to be down here
With all the English boys

And I don't know where I am now
Or where I'm gonna go
I just keep going round and round on the circle line
Like some demented kind a cummuta
Trying to avoid paying for my ticket
I'm a lost soul
I read about myself in the newspapers
I'm a pig
I'm a thug
I've got nowhere to go but down

Feel like I'm kicking at a dead man
Kicking in the chorus
I'm broken by hatred
While politicians just ignore us
You never gave me any value
You didn't give me any reason
There's no tools and no toys
For any English boys

I'm an English boy
I was brought up right
Hold me down
And I will bite
I know no fear
I will serve with joy

No tools, no toys for any English boy

Swear like a sailor
Speaking in gang tongues
Kicking in chorus
Stabbing to order
Slashing like a blind man
Lost like a soldier

I was an English boy
Precisely made
You could pin me down
I was not afraid
I showed no fear

I was so proud to be here

Stand up, stand up, stand up!

Slow like a prejudice
Broken like a hatred
Kicking at a dead man
Cut pieces to pieces
Marking your territory
Freezing the future
Stopping the stopwatch

Fabricate the way you feel

Fake it anyway

"Well, would you believe
That after my mention of Ray High last week
He's been seen out and about in the big city
Until now Ray's been locked away
Struggling with a follow-up to his last mega-excess

But rumor was he couldn't even open a bottle
Without a drink inside him
There was talk of a nervous breakdown
He's even got up the nose of his sexy manager

Poor old Rastus Knight
Now has a challenged coke habit
I've always had a soft spot for Rastus
And I've often seen him looking at it

While I was away in 'Frisco
I hear Ray went into my club and sat at my table
Why thanks Ray
That put an end to happy hour

Why my place anyway, Ray?
Nobody there who's anybody cares two filo faxes
About peace and love

I heard about you Mr. Stinking, rich
Has been rodent, drinking vintage Krug
As though it was two bob a bottle
I'll be watching out for you

Free ride to the house of life
Free ride to the house of life
Free ride to the house of life

Free ride to the house of life
Free ride to the house of life
Free ride

I work hard at my job, I save and I save
I know what I deserve after all that I gave
You know I want that thing
You know I want that thing

Put aside a little money almost every day
When I think that I'm close it just gets further away
You know I want that thing
I want that thing

Free ride to the house of life

I don't know if it's truth, don't know if it's lies
Just can't be aloof to what you advertise
You know I want that thing
And I want that thing, c'mon boy

I can't wait any longer to choose
Can't get my own, gonna have to take yours from you
I want that thing, I really want that thing
I want it, I want it, I really, really, really want that thing

Free ride
(I want that thing)
Free ride
(I want that thing)

Free ride to the house of life

Free ride to the house of life
(I want that thing)
Free ride, I wanna free ride

I've planned an alternative
I will secretly commandeer one of the Grid life studios
And stage a live rock concert
For every single person wearing Grid suits
That's fifty percent of the world's population
The result will be amazing

Everyone who experiences the concert
Will slip out of their suit and come to the show
They will be drawn to it
This will produce the biggest live concert audience in history

It's got something, something special, I could really dream then
It ain't such a bad dream either.

Walking to a club
I've been completely degraded by chasing publicity
Degraded, yeah, I'll never go back, I know too much
I know how it's done, I can't discover it all over again, make it seem new

You're great, Ray, you know that, man, here, hold up, this is the place
What? Can't go in here, that bloody cow Ruth Streeting uses this club
She hates my guts
It's her job to hate your guts, she's a journalist, it's nothing personal

Oh sod it, I forgot, of course she won't be here, she's in the States
Oh c'mon, let's go in anyway
We've got to get back in the mainstream sometime
Come on, you own shares in the place

Yes, you are
No, I'm not
Well, you are, actually

Clutching to exclude
A dozen different stenches
In Falmouth Bay
A blue whale rolls
Going to drown in the swill
From city sewer holes
Summers longer
Deltas gashed
Ancient trees
Uprooted, smashed
Time is generous more, take more
I must outrun the dinosaur

A silent temple
Marble hard
Decays and softens
Battle scarred
A relic deaf
To bits and streams
And polo necks
And perfect jeans
Obsessed with silence
Spiked by noise
I hold my son
I plan our toys
Time expansive more, take more
I must outlive the dinosaur

Rising rivers
Drown new shoots
Words and breath
In death cahoots
The strong survive
To wean more brutes
Who grow and seed
Extend their roots
Cowards, bombs
And scab recruits
Like monkeys trapped
In monkey suits
Time is plentiful more, take more
I must outfight the dinosaur",6

"I remember being richer than a king
The minutes of the day were golden
I recall that when the joint passed round
My body felt a little colder
But now I'm like a sewer channel - running lime and scag
Let me get at the master panel - let me at my stack

The sea refuses no river
And right now this river's banks are blown
The sea refuses no river
Whether stinking and rank
Or red from the tank
Whether pure as a spring
There's no damned thing stops the poem
The sea refuses no river
And this river is homeward flowing

I have seen a trace of strain
In other's eyes not spoken
I must admit that I enjoyed their pain
But this time it's me that's broken
I demand for you and His
This must be the time
When we decide what freedom is
Turn water into wine

For the sea refuses no river
We're polluted now but in our hearts still clean
The sea refuses no river
We tried not to age
But time had it's rage
We're washed over stones
From babes into clones of the mean
The sea won't refuse this muddy river
Nor deny the sulfurous stream

There was a fool in a dressing robe
Riding out the twilight hour
Lonely and cold in an empty home
Trying to assess his power
But now he's like a stream in flood
Swollen by the storm
He doesn't care if he sheds his blood
Let him be reborn

For the sea refuses no river
Remember that when the beggar buys a round
The sea refuses no river
And rain fills the gutters
No time for stutters
This is our chance
To sing and to dance and to clown
The sea refuses no river
And rivers were sprung to drown

The sea refuses no river
No pecking code respected for the damned
The sea refuses no river
Whether starving or ill
Or strung on some pill
Just ''cause you own the land
There's no unique hand plugs the dam
The sea refuses no river
And the river is where I am

The river is where I am",5
"I'm sittin' in the Sheraton Gibson playin' my Gibson

"There are men high up there fishing.
Haven't seen quite enough of the world.
I ain't seen a sign of my hero
And I'm still diving down for pearls.
Oh, let me flow into the ocean,
Let me get back to the sea,
Let me be stormy and let me be calm,
Let the tide in
I want it to rush over me .

I'm flowing under bridges
Then flying through the sky,
I'm traveling down cold metal
Just a tear in a baby's eye.
Let me flow into the ocean, 
Let me get back to the sea,
Let me be stormy and let me be calm,
Let the tide in
I want it to rush over me 
I want to drown,etc.

I am not the actor.
This can't be the scene.
But I am in the water
As far as I can see.

I'm remembering distant memories,
Recalling other names,
Rippling over canyons,
I'm boiling in the train,
Let me flow into the ocean, 
Let me get back to the sea,
Let me be stormy and let me be calm,
Let the tide in
I want it to rush over me .

I want to drown in your sweet sweet love,etc.",5

"If your traveling in the north country a far
Where the winds hit heavy on the border line.
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.

And when you go, and the snow flakes fall
The rivers freeze, and summer ends
Please see for me, that she's wearing a coat so warm
Keep her from... that howling wind.

Please see for me that her hair is hanging long
And flows and flows on down her breast.
Please see for me that her hair is hanging long
For that's the way I remember her the best.

I'm wondering if she remembers me at all
The many times I've often laid
In the darkness of my light
The brightness, of my day.

So if your traveling to the north country far
Where the winds hit heavy 
Where the winds hit heavy on the border line
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was
She once was, a true love of mine",6
"When you're feeling low
Try a day of silence
Take things very slow
Listen to the wireless

Never speak a sound
Sit up on the hedgerow
Watch the world go round
Peace will let your mind go

When you've had a row
Sit alone say nothing
It's really funny how
You quickly see that something

Wonderful and warm
Lies between each second
In every side and out
Eternity will beckon

You and me, we are part of a single soul
And one day we will know we're one
Sit and listen the word will come
There is nothing beneath the sun that we can't realize

And one peaceful night
Will remind us that it's alright
And we'll figure we owe it all
To one life of silence

Whispers will emerge
Proud against the thunder
The wind hiss precious words
Erase our problems rumble

Watch a speckled fawn
Hear it crash like seaspray
Someone sees it all
We will meet him someday

When you're feeling low
Try a day of silence
Take things very slow
Maybe listen to the wireless

"When you and I are having problems
Pretend you're simply me, and I am you
Watch the way we weep and slip under
Making love before the evening through.

Say hello to the love man
You can't afford to pass him by
Say hello to the love man
Now I've said it, don't forget it, you'd regret it
Or tomorrow , die.

Don't you know that he's in our town
Someone wrote it on the wall
Just for us he can be found
But do we really need to call.
Care at all.

Say hello to the love man
You can't afford to pass him by
Say hello to the love man
Now I've said it, don't forget it, you'd regret it
If tomorrow he should die.

Yaaaah
(Guitar Solo)

Tickle me don't let me hear him singing
Dance for me don't let me see his face
Sing for me don't answer any questions
Love me don't love him don't lead the race.

He didn't even come out of his caravan
Just swung these leapers out the door
How can you imagine that he's human
Can I match your money you have seen before.
Never less I will

Say hello to the love man
You can't afford to pass him by
Say hello to the love man
Now I've said it, don't forget it, you'd regret it
Cause tomorrow he's going to die

Say hello to the love man 
Say hello to the love man
Say hello to the love man

"'Jai Baba, folks

Mary Jane became a good friend to me
He showed me ways, a different way to be
But now's comes a time to move further down the line
So get your ten lil' fingers off of me

Mary Jane promised me so much
My soul has been used to your touch
But for every thing you gave, I then became your slave
Mary Jane, please take your hands off of me this minute

There are millions out there waiting for your charms
So proud Mary, go and take them in your arms
And threw her lovely eyes, you'll see a new sunrise
But will they see the things as they are?

They've taken me on one fantastic life
They've seen how I failed when I tried
I think that now and then I could take you again
But now I've got someone else inside

Mary Jane there are things that I've been told
By a man who is very, very old
He says it's up to me and if I can but see
His silver will give way to his gold

"I've looked under chairs
I've looked under tables
I try to find the key
To fifty million fables

[Chorus]
They call me the Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't find what I'm after
Till the day I die

I asked my idols
The questions to my mother
I bought tickets just anywhere
Hoping to discover

[Chorus]

People tend to hate me
Cause I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They want to shake my hand
Focused in on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a Seeker, I'm a really desperate man!

I asked Bobby Dylan 
I asked the Beatles 
I asked Timothy Leary 
But he didn't help me either

They call me the Seeker
I've been looking low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Now look at my face
Ain't this a smile?
I'm happy when life's good
And when it's bad, I cry
I got values
But I don't know how or why

I'm looking for me!
You're looking for you!
We're looking at each other
And we don't know what to do!

[Chorus]

I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die!",4
"Sleeping dog by the open fire,
You're sleeping your life away;
You don't know how far you've got to go
Or the trouble that you'll have to face. 

If all I can do is love you,
Provide you with some fun and food.
All I can do is love you,
And that is what I do. 

Sleeping children laying in your beds,
Tomorrow you'll be back at school.
You look so young, but you've come so far.
You'll never be any souls' fool. 

All I can do is love you,
Provide you with some fun and food.
All I can do is love you,
And that is what I do. 

All I can do is love you,
Provide you with some fun and food.
All I can do is love you,
And that is what I do. 

Now I'm going up to my wife;
Baba, I pray to you.
Love me just a little like I love them,
And I can do some sleeping, too. 

All I can do is love you,
Provide you with a song.
All I can do is love you
Like you've been loving me all along. 

All I can do is love you,
Provide you with a verse or two.
All I can do is love you,
And that is what I do",7
"I'd gladly lose me to find you
I'd gladly give up all I have
To find you I'd suffer anything and be glad

I'd pay any price to get you
I'd work all my life and I will
To win you, I'd stand naked, stoned and stabbed

I call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had

I'd gladly lose me to find you
I'd gladly give up what I got
To catch you, I'm gonna run and never stop

I'd pay any price to win you
Surrender my good life for bad
To find you, I'm gonna drown an unsung man

I call that a bargain
The best I ever had
The best I ever had

I sit looking 'round
I look at my face in the the mirror
I know I'm worth nothing without you

And like one and one don't make two
One and one make one
And I'm looking for that free ride to me
I'm looking for you

I'd gladly lose me to find you
I'd gladly give up all I got
To catch you, I'm gonna run and never stop

"I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said ""You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away""
I staggered back to the underground
You know the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair

Who are you? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I said (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

Took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rollin' Pin
Feel a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccuped
Looked back on my busy day
I was Eleven hours in the Tin Can
There's got to be better way

(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
You know I really need to know 
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
 (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

Let me tell you who I am
I am the man 
That is scared of concrete
For you I have a plan
I put my money in the bank
I don't keep it in my hand
And sometimes it all goes wrong I make a stand
Whenever, I walk down the street I feel afraid
People want there money cause they want to get paid
All I want is a little love and to live my life
And all I want for return is my very own wife
Why do people in red
Who are you who do you fear
When I take this knife and in your eyes I sneer
When I look at the people who came from the sixties
Up through the nineties now we reach this pentacle
Understand that the reason to exist
Is that life is something that you live have to persist
Who could just forget the place where we came
My name is Pete Townshend we want you just the same
Who are you
Who who who who are you

Who are you?

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
You know I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this?

(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
I really want to know? (Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)
(Who are you? Who, who, who, who?)

I can just remember about who I am

"The iron man came to the top of the cliff
How far had he walked nobody knows
Where had he come from nobody knows
How was he made, nobody knows
Taller than a house, the iron man stood
At the top of the cliff in the darkness

The wind sang through his iron fingers
And his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin
But as big as a bedroom
Slowly turned to the right, slowly turned to the left
He was hearing the sea

His eyes like headlamps, glowed white then red
Then infra-red, searching the sea
Never before had the iron man seen the sea

He swayed in the strong wind that pressed against his back
He swayed forward on the brink of the high cliff
And his right foot, his enormous iron right foot
Lifted-up out into space

And the iron man stepped forward, off the cliff into nothingness
Crash
Down the cliff, the iron man came toppling head over heels
Crash, crash, crash

From rock to rock, tumbling slowly
And as he crashed and crashed, his iron legs fell off
His iron arms broke off
And the hands broke off the arms

His great iron ears fell off
And his eyes fell out
His great iron head fell off

All the separate pieces tumbled scattered crashing
Bumping clanging down, on to the rocky beach far below
Then silence

Nobody knew the iron man had fallen
Nobody knew the iron man had fallen",6

But you seemed to think
I deserved all indulgence I dared

We shared the same golden spoon
Unaware of who was feeding whom
Back then at the start
We could eat with anyone we cared

I should've known you was full
By the way that you handed to me
We both got so old
I couldn't say how we planned it to be

No need to pull any punch
Love Maxims for lunch
With the fresh broken heart
You will eat with anyone that's agreeing

We were full on Caprese
We laughed while we dine
I served the entrees
You served the spirits and the wine

But time heals and while
We laughed through our meals
I cheated desire
Fading and tired and pine

So won't you RSVP now
Say it right to my face
Have a Maxim more for the road
And let's get out of this place

I spent too long on the queue
You over drank the Le Tour
Let's get back to wafers and water
I can't stand the pace

I spent too long on the mic
While you were loving to type

We can both say what the hell we like",6

"Circles, my head is going round in circles
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool
Dragging me down

Time will tell if I can live without you
I'm trying but I'll never get threw
Circles bring me back to you

Everything I do, I think of you
No matter how I try, I can't get by...
These circles, there leading me back to you

Round and around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around... And round and round like a fool I go
Down and down in the pool I go
Dragging me down

Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track
I don't know why I? I won't come back
Dizziness will make my feet walk back
Come on back to you

I'm coming on back to you
Leading me back to you
Circles lead me back to you
Circles lead me back to you",5

Leave a little time, won't ya drink a little wine
And in the meantime
Play with the Grecian Hawaiian five in the water
Let's roll in the water,swimming in the water
It's all gona clear up someday

I go halfway 'round the world
I need another girl
But when I see her all I do is think of you

We take a drink at my hotel
I pray for your telephone bell
But it's my turn to call you won't come through

I never wanna hurt you again
I tried to change my life, I promise this
The only trouble is you know
I think I like it the way it is
I think I like it the way it is

As I lay awake alone
I know you are waiting home
And there's really nothing going on

I try to please the local crew
'Cause they say they love me too
But I'm really only showing off

I never wanna hurt you again
I tried to change my life, I promise this
The only trouble is you know
I think I like it the way it is
I think I like it the way it is

My heart, oh, my heart is aching
And I'm lonely for you
But I know that really must seem
Like so many words of truth

Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling
Am I even worth your frown?
The sweetness of your kiss is gone
I've brought a curse to you now

Things I've said don't stay with me

Please don't you befriend my lonely words

Don't take them in
My lonely words
Please don't befriend

In a sandstorm, words are wind born
Lonely sheets torn from a love alone
Journal full of plans
That should melt in your hands, oh

I'm afraid I spoke too soon again

I thought it important to try to explain

The way the beach is kissed by the sea
Only love can make it rain
Like the sweat of lovers
Laying in the fields

Love, reign o'er me
Love, reign o'er me, reign o'er me.

Only love can bring the rain
That makes you yearn to the sky
Only love can bring the rain
That falls like tears from on high

Love, love reign o'er me, reign o'er me
Love, reign o'er me, reign o'er me

On the dry and dusty road
The nights we spent apart alone
I need to get back home
To cool cool rain
I can't sleep and lay and I think
The nights are hot and black as ink
Oh God, I need a drink
Of cool, cool rain.

Love, love, love reign o'er me, reign o'er me
Love reign o'er me
Love, love, love reign o'er me, reign on me
Reign on me

Don't pretend you're groovy
Don't be swayed and shell shocked

Jackie's on the craving
Rabbits on the raving
Their on the way with a tooth force

Enter at your own game
Horse is trapped and ignorant

Zelda is waving with her two hands
Freddy's is making up a new band

You know he's never really seen us
He's come back to brandy
Well that's very handy

To raise his kids, it's just amazing

Roger's little baby
Zelda screams not to touch her

Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.

Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

There's this about you
My world's an empty world without you

Sweeter than the roses in May

Skies above me

Melody haunting me

You can't start a fire without a spark

Radios on and I'm moving round the place

I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man I ain't getting nowhere just living
In a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know that there is

You can't start a fire
You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and its on me
Ill shake this world off my shoulder
Come on baby the laughs on me

Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting round here trying to write
This book
I need a love reaction
Come on now baby gimme just one look

You can't start a fire sitting round crying
Over a broken heart
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about
Your little world falling apart
This guns for hire
Even if were just dancing in the dark
Even if were just dancing in the dark",4

I can't change anything, I can't change anything.
Anything.

I was out on my own, for the first time.
It was here all along, that I cracked.
Now it won't happen again till the next time.
Yeah I think I can do this all by myself.

I've been thinking of you a lot this morning.
For the fifty seven thousandth time today.
I will see you in pictures dressed as I am.
I can change anything, I can change anything.
Oh anything.

I would like to tell you, where I'm going to.
I've seen it before, I've seen it before.
I would like to tell you, this is not about you.
I've seen it before, I've seen it before.

So come on wheels
Take me home today

"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

They grew and grew to the old church tower
And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",6
"I don't want to see you again.
I hear that love is planned,
How can I understand,
When someone says to me,

""I don't want to see you again.""?
Why do I cry at night?
Something wrong could be right.
I hear you say to me,

""I don't want to see you again.""
As you turned your back to me,
You hid the light of day.
I didn't have to play,

At being broken hearted.
I know that later on,
After love's been and gone,
I'd still hear someone say,

""I don't want to see you again.""

As you turned your back on me,
You hid the light of day.
I didn't have to play,
At being broken hearted.

I get so shaky and I feel so weak
I tell my eyes look the other way
But they don't seem to hear a word I say
And I, go to pieces and I want to hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by
I tell my arms they'll hold someone new
Another love that will be true
But they don't listen, they don't seem to care
They reach for her but she's not there
And I, go to pieces and I want to hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by
I remember what she said when she said
""Goodbye baby. We'll meet again soon maybe.""
""But until we do, all my best to you.""
I'm so lonely, I think about her only
I go to places we used to go
But I know she'll never show
She hurt me so much inside
Now I hope she's satisfied
And I, go to pieces and I want to hide
Go to pieces and I almost die
Every time my baby passes by
Go to pieces and I cry
Every time my baby passes by
Go to pieces and I cry",6
"Long ago in days of old
There lived a knight who
Wasn't quite as bold
As a knight should be

He rode an old grey mare called Bess
Searchin' for a damsel in distress
Just to see if he
Could set her free

See the knight in rusty armour ride
To her aid
Trusty sword is hanging at his side
With a rusty blade

Up the tower steps he sneaked
But as he moved
His rusty armour squeaked
Such a mournful note

And all the sentries at their posts
Thought it must have been the castle ghost
They jumped for their lives
In the moat

So the knight in rusty armour won
His fair maid
Had no need to draw his trusty sword
With a rusty blade

As he bent to kiss his bride
He found that he was
Rusted up inside
In his battle dress
And I can't guess

How they still got married
And had twins
They came in tins
Every suit of armour ever made
Has a kink
Chain mail pants with a missing link

"Seventeen, a beauty queen
She made a ride that caused a scene
In the town
Her long blonde hair
Hangin' down around her knees
All the cats who dig striptease
Prayin' for a little breeze
Her long blonde hair
Falling down across her arms
Hiding all the lady's charms
Lady Godiva
She found fame and made her name
A Hollywood director came into town
And said to her
""How'd you like to be a star?""
""You're a girl that could go far""
""Especially dressed the way you are""
She smiled at him
Gave her pretty head a shake
That was Lady G's mistake
A-hey-hey-hey
Lady Godiva
He directs certificate 'X'
And people now are craning their necks
To see her
'Cause she's a star
One that everybody knows
Finished with the striptease shows
Now she can't afford her clothes
Her long blonde hair
Lyin' on the barber's floor
Doesn't need it long anymore
Lady Godiva",5
"Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.

Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise,
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,

It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one,
When other lovers are gone we'll live on,
We'll live on.

------ guitar solo -------
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise,
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,

Nobody I know could love me more than you,
You can give me such love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.

"Why can't you see?
 Oh, how blind can you be?
 To know, know, know you
 Is to love, love, love you
 
 Just to see you smile
 Makes my life worthwhile
 To know, know, know you
 Is to love, love, love you
 
 And I do, yes I do, yes I do
 I'll be good to you
 And I'll bring love to you
 Oh, everyone says there'll come a day

 When I'll walk along side of you
 And to know, know, know you
 Is to love, love, love you
 And I do, yes I do, yes I do

 Why can't you see?
 Oh, how blind can you be?
 Someday you'll see
 That you were meant for me

 To know, know, know you
 Is to love, love, love you
 Just to see you smile
 Makes my life worthwhile

 To know, know, know you
 Is to love, love, love you
 And I do, yes I do, yes I do
 And I do, yes I do, yes I do

 Yes I do",7
"Yes you know why
Why you and I
Will by and by
Know true love ways

Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why 
Just you and I
Know true love ways

Throughout the days
Our true love ways
Will bring us joy to share
With those who really care

Sometimes we'll sigh
Sometimes we'll cry
And we'll know why 
Just you and I 
Know true love ways",7
"Woman, do you love me?
 Woman, if you need me then
 Believe me I need you
 To be my woman
 
 Woman, do you love me?
 Woman, if you need me then
 Believe me I need you
 To be my woman

 And should you ask me how I'm doing
 What shall I say? Things are OK
 But I know that they're not
 And I still may have lost you

 Woman, do you love me?
 Woman, if you need me then
 Believe me I need you
 To be my woman

 I guess you'll take your time and tell me
 When we're alone, love will come home
 I would give up my world
 If you'll say that my girl is my woman

 I've got plenty of time
 Just to get through it
 Once again you'll be mine
 I still think we can do it

 And you know how much I love you
 Woman, don't forsake me
 Woman, if you take me then
 Believe me I'll take you
 To be my woman",8
"Please lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

[Chorus]
I don't care what they say I won't stay
In a world without love

Birds sing out of tune
And rain clouds hide the moon
I'm OK, here I'll stay
With my loneliness

[Chorus]

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does I lose
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

[Chorus]

So I wait and in a while
I will see my true love's smile
She may come, I know not when
When she does I lose
So baby until then

Lock me away
And don't allow the day
Here inside where I hide
With my loneliness

"Now my room has got two windows
But the sunshine never comes through
You know it's always dark and dreary
Since I broke up with you baby

I live on a lonely avenue
My love don't say I do
But I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you
I could cry, I could cry
Whoa I need somebody
Because I live on a lonely avenue

You know my cover it feel like lead
And my pillow it feel like stone
But I toss and turn every night
I'm not used to being alone

I live on a lonely avenue
My love don't say I do
But I feel so sad and blue
You know it's all because of you
I could cry, I could cry
Whoa I need somebody
Because I live on a lonely avenue

Now I live so sad and lonesome
Since you left this town
You know if I could beg or borrow the money
Child I would be a-highway bound

I live on a lonely, lonely avenue
My girl wouldn't say I do
But I feel so sad and blue
And it's all because of you
I could cry, I could cry baby
Whoa I need somebody
Because I live on a lonely avenue",5

"I'll never let you see
The way my broken heart is hurting me
I've got my pride and I know how to hide
All the sorrow and pain
I'll do my crying in the rain

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

Someday when my crying's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool
But till then, darling, you'll never see me complain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain
I'll do my crying in the rain",5

"A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.
The green leaves of Summer are callin' me home.
'Twas so good to be young then, in a season of plenty,
When the catfish were jumpin' as high as the sky.

A time just for plantin', a time just for ploughin'.
A time to be courtin' a girl of your own.
'Twas so good to be young then, to be close to the earth,
And to stand by your wife at the moment of birth.

A time to be reapin', a time to be sowin'.

And the owl in the pine tree a-winkin' his eye.

A time just for livin', a place for to die.

On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
Wait, wait along

I do not know what fate awaits me
I only know I must be brave
And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love and duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his'n
I'm not afraid of death but oh
What will I do if you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

Now that I need you by my side

"If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand?
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you,
I must be sure
From the very start
That you,
Would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh please,
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her,
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I,
Would be sad if our new love,
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I,
Would love to love you,
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two.
If I fell in love with you",7
"I bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me

Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me

Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
What would life be

So never ever leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Let it be me

To you I'm praying
Hear what I'm saying
Please let your heart beat
For me, for me, just for me

Don't take this heaven
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Now and forever
Now and forever
Let it, let it, let it, let it be me",6
"Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

"I'm sitting in the railway station. 
Got a ticket to my destination. 
On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. 
And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one-man band. 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 
Ev'ry day's an endless stream 
Of cigarettes and magazines. 
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories 
And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, 
Homeward bound, 
I wish I was, 
Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me. 

Tonight I'll sing my songs again, 
I'll play the game and pretend. 
But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity 
Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. 
Homeward bound,

Homeward bound, 
Home where my thought's escaping, 
Home where my music's playing, 
Home where my love lies waiting 
Silently for me.

'Cause my uncle took a message and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd call me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge

Last time I saw Marie she was waving me goodbye
With ""hurry-home"" drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Only that I miss her and all the fun we had

"The late george wallno 
Worked on high street and lived on manners
52 years he sat on his verandah, made his saddles
And if you had questions about sheep or flowers or doves
You just asked the saddler, he lived without sin
They're building a library for him

Time is a traveller
Tenterfield saddler
Turn your head
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead

The son of george wallno went off and got married and had a war baby
But something was wrong and it's easier to drink than go crazy
And if there were questions about why the end was so sad
Well george had no answers about why her son ever has need of a gun

Time is a traveller
Tenterfield saddler
Turn your head
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead

The grandson of george has been all around the world and lives no special place
Changed his last name and he married a girl with an interesting face
He'd almost forgotten them both because of the life that he leads
There's nowhere for george and his library or the son with his gun to belong
Except in this song

"Comin' home used to feel so good
I'm a stranger now in my neighborhood
I've seen the world at a faster pace
And I'm comin' now from a different place

Though I may look the same way to you
Underneath there is somebody new

I am not the boy next door
I don't belong like I did before
Nothin' ever seems like it used to be
You can have your dreams, but you can't have me

I can't go back there anymore
'Cause I am not the boy next door

You've been savin' all souvenirs
Faded photographs from my foolish years
We made plans, but they're wearin' thin
And they won't work out 'cause I don't fit in

And those memories will just weigh me down
'Cause I got no place to keep 'em uptown

I am not the boy next door
I don't belong like I did before
Nothin' ever seems like it used to be
You can have your dreams, but you can't have me

I can't go back there anymore
'Cause I am not the boy next door

But if you'd look past the past you could see
That

I don't belong like I did before

"Once in your life you find her
Someone that turns your heart around
And next thing you know you're closing down the town
Wake up and it's still with you
Even though you left her way across town
Wondering to yourself, ""Hey, what've I found?""

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do
The best that you can do is fall in love

Arthur he does as he pleases
All of his life, he's mastered choice
Deep in his heart, he's just, he's just a boy
Living his life one day at a time
And showing himself a really good time
Laughing about the way they want him to be

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,
The best that you can do is fall in love

When you get caught between the Moon and New York City
I know it's crazy, but it's true
If you get caught between the Moon and New York City
The best that you can do,
The best that you can do is fall in love",7

Where you used to play

Even leave your pool and your car
Only to find you no longer belong

Yeah, hit the streets at midnight
Still dancing after dawn
But something seems to be missing
Just what are you running from

Do you like your love in the dark
Or laid out in the sun?

Don't you know what you've become

You can always hear me singing
Oh, say can you see?
From the towers of Manhattan
To the hills of Beverly

All those girls on TV movies
All those boys on Broadway

You know you go either way

Dreams can come true again
When everything old is new again

Put it on backwards when forward fails
Better leave Greta Garbo alone
Be a movie star on your own

Well then you pull a string that pulls me back
If not for you I might lose track

And I might fly away
Oh I might fly away, and go my own way
To places that we've never been together
I might fly away (fly away), take to the sky some day
But not for now, not today
Nobody here is flyin' away, away

You have reasons, I have dreams
So we're perfect, so it seems
You talk fortunes, I tell the truth
Kept me from my crazy youth
When you're near me I fee-eel whole
I don't have to rock and roll
I don't worry, I don't think
But baby hold me close and I won't break

I made my choice in life
I chose to settle down
I chose to take a wife

And I take pleasure in my quiet
Hearth and happy home
I never gave my heart
Its chance to roam

I could have been a sailor
And sailed the seven seas
The wind in my face all day
Can you taste the salty breeze?

I could have been a lover
Watchin' waves before me part
But I settled for safer harbors of my heart

I'm a lucky man
I'm the envy of my peers
I never ask for favors
Oh, and I never show my fears

Surrounded by too many friends
I am a one-man band
With all the trappings of a life
Lived second-hand

I could have been a sailor
Rollin' through the night
My sails before the wind
Where the star's my only light

I could have been a dreamer
Yeah, but dreams just fall apart
So, I settled for safer harbors of my heart

And I take pleasure in my quiet
Hearth and happy home

And sailed the seven seas

And can you taste the salty breeze?

You don't have to answer

And you must realize
That it's comin' from my heart
And not my head

I love you, I honestly love you

I'm not trying to make
You feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all

But this feeling doesn't come along everyday
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

I love you, I honestly love you

If we both were born
In another place in time
This moment might be ending in a kiss

But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this

I thought that I knew it all
My perseption of love
Well it was something to do

But I wonder would you be around
If I loved you the right way
Loved you the right way
I would have put that smile upon your face
Loved you the right way
Never thought that id thank you for the hert and the pain
And the changes you put me through
I guess I needed to look at my intensions again
I didn't give enough to you
My mind has never been so clear
And I feel my happiness is near
But I wonder if you'd still be here if I loved you the right way

'Cause you diserve the right way
I should have put that smile upon your face
I should have kept you in my warm embrace
Loved you the right way

Simple values put aside

I'll remember what I learnt from you
Yeah
And I will love her the right way
Love her the right way
I will put that smile on her face

Shouting that love is grand, and
To hold a man in your arms is wonderful, wonderful

No discussion

Reechy poison
Mess with distortions

Eating well, sleeping well

A long time ago,
'cause I heard some song I used to hear back then,
A lone time ago.
I remember when, even further back,
In another town,
'cause I saw something written I used to say back then,
Hard to comprehend

And the question is, was I more alive
Then than I am now?
I happily have to disagree;
I laugh more often now, I cry more often now,
I am more me.

But of cause some days, I just lie around
And hardly exist,
And can't tell apart what I'm eating
From my hand or my wrist.
'cause flesh is flesh, flesh as flesh as flesh,
The difference is thin.
But life has a certain ability or breathing new
Life into me,
So I breathe it in.
It says here we are, and we all are here,
And you still can make sense,
If you just show up and present an honest face,
Instead of that grin.

And the other day, this new friend of mine
Said something to me
""just because something starts differently,
Doesn't mean it's worth less.""
And I soaked it in, how I soaked it in,
How I soaked it in
And just as to prove how right he was,
Then you came.

I'm gonna give you a try,

We're all about each other.
I'm all about you, you're all about me,
We're all about each other.

You don't have to tell, 'cause I know so well
What we are all after.

I have to zoom in on your laughter.

Cold feet, your sister is sweet, oh, so sweet
But listen, it's you I'd like to meet
Calm down, you act like a clown

Can't pretend here comes the end
And I can't help it, I want you, you, you, you",5

We were changing from you and me

It will go to show

When history is done
And everything is over
Just to keep us warm
It's slowly getting colder
There's nothing to explain
It's hard to stay the same

Early morning, and late night
Going over the same fight
Don't move me no more
You don't move me no more

All these things I keep
Without caring too deep
Gonna put it to sleep
I can run much faster

Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to

The gambler out in me

You can deal me in this time around
Even though the odds are high
We'll play them down
You may be a chance I need to take
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

If this is luck then let it ride
If it's the stars
They're surely on my side
I've never been so satisfied
By love before
For all the times I've tried

These beginnings could mean more
Than the brief affair I bargained for
Little did I know when we began
That my time had come to win a hand

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

Please forgive me if I seem
To be walking through a waking dream
Laughter never came so easily
There's a freedom here that's new to me

Happy is the way I'm feelin'
And I know it comes from being with you
All at once my life is changin'
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love
With you
Fallin' in love with you
Fallin' in love
Fallin' in love with you

"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were
The way we were",5
"All or nothing... push
All or nothing... Girl let it be

Night after night it starts the same
Talking with my baby on lovers lane
You're real sweet and all a glow
Turn me on and then you're ready to go
I ask her, baby can I walk you home
She says okay I hate to be alone
I'm dreaming, you're smiling
You're my girl
My fantasy in this world
Nothing is wrong with being in love
It's a wonderful feeling from heaven above
Squeeze me
Please me
Turn me on
I love you so much
You can never go wrong
I like your smile
I like your touch
All or nothing
'Cos I want you so much
I'm longing for your tender kiss
Baby I wanna tell you this :

All or nothing... push
It's got to be
Something's gotta show
When you're living under heat
All or nothing... push
Girl let it be
Take it from a pro
Who's rocking to the beat

I'm under heat oh baby
Please take it slow
Give me some time and maybe
Our love will grow

I wanna suit you baby
And make it right
Take it from me babe
I wanna rock all night

If it's good for me
It's good for you, you gotta
Never let your mood get dry
Just keep it wet and my 740 jet
Is pushing right on high
You're the girl of my dream
You're making me hot
You're looking good
You're too ot to trot
I wanna be with you through all the hours and shower you with all my
flowers
I like your smile
I like your touch
All or nothing
'Cos I want you so much

I'm longing for your tender kiss
Baby I wanna tell you this :

All or nothing... push
It's got to be
Something's gotta show
When you're living under heat
All or nothing... push

Take it from me babe

"You've heard all about your raggy melody
Everything from opera down to harmony
But I've a little song that I will sing to you
It's gonna win you through and through
There ain't much to the words but the music is grand
And you'll be a-singing it to beat the band
You've heard of the tisket and tasket it's true
But give a little listen to this will you?

Our bands have been digging back for tunes to be sung
Operas and nursery rhymes have been overdone
I dug a little deeper and I found this thing
It's ragtime but it still can swing
It ain't a turkeytrot or a shimmey onestep
But when grandma danced to it
She thought she was hep
It still is a ditty 
I'm sure you will find
Will keep a runnin' 'round and around your mind

I have no instruments, no instruments
I'm using yours
I'm throwing pillows on the floor, on the floor

And when I'm home, I'm not at home
And when I'm home, I'm not at home
I'm having thoughts of driving in a storm
I was in a storm

I'm not in love

Run into you",7
"The lady smiled at me when she asked about the possibility
That we might spend some time alone
And oh the thoughts that filled my head
When she looked in my eyes and slowly said
Do ya want to get funky with me, do ya wanna...oh!

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Do ya want to get funky with me, do ya want to?
Do ya want to get funky

The way she spoke to me told me I had the opportunity
To see how funky she could be
And when I looked into her eyes
The fire they held made me realize
Her flame was burning just for me

The lady tempted me
I closed my eyes, it was plain to see
She was the devil in disguise
And oh the message she'd relay
When she would take my hand and say
Do ya want to get funky with me, do ya want to?

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Do ya want to get funky with me, do ya want to?

I want to set ya on fire
'Cause it's hot
'Cause it's hot

It's so hot I'm burning up
It's so hot I'm burning up
Oh no no no

I felt the heat within, the lust of love and the urge to sin
I felt her reachin' for my soul
And then I knew I had no choice
But to heed the command of the devil's voice
Do ya want to get funky with me, do ya want to, do ya want to, do ya want to?

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Do ya want to get funky with me, do ya want to get funky
Do ya want to get funky with me, do ya want to?

The idle mind is a playground for the devil
Ah, do ya want to get funky with me, do ya want to?
Do ya want to get funky with me?",6

"The waltz of the Angels I hear each night
I hold you tightly in these arms of mine
It's surely from heaven, this music I hear
When your lips say I love you
In waltz time my dear
		
There must be a higher world, much higher than ours
A writer of love songs way up in the sky
The maker of roses, of love sweet and true
And the waltz of the Angels
The moonlight and you
		
There must be a higher world, much higher than ours
A writer of love songs way up in the sky
The maker of roses, of love sweet and true
And the waltz of the Angels

"This place has changed since we were the kings
The shops torn down where we pawned our rings
8 by 10's no one sees no more
Like Telly Savalas hangin' by the door, Palookaville

Well, you can't tell your baby how a left jab feels
The first you take rocks you on your heels
Soon you're back in the car up for the long ride home
The canvas is splattered with your blood and bone, Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

The crowd was dressed in leathers and lace
They scream for more, why you work this fast?
Then they tore up their programs and they jumped to their feet
Whatd'ya say, we go get somethin' to eat? Over in Palookaville

Palookaville cast off by crooks
A punch drunk fighter with two left hooks
You only blame yourself for the way it went
You threw away your chances now you're sweatin' the rent
All in Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

Now you're one of the crowd walkin' where they walk
There's a new kid hoppin' and talkin' the talk
But you know what's it's like fallin' off'a the map
Your heaven sent treasure got sprung like a trap
Over Palookaville

Now there's a boy in the dark he's got a ways to go
Underneath the covers with a radio
He's tunin' in a fight from Bangor Maine
Once you catch the bug it's never the same, Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

"Another night, another show
Another day so far to go
Couple hours, motel room
I'll be back on my highway soon

Forget tomorrow and the jam you're in
You're alive right now as you've ever been
The line you shoot will never miss
That's the old soul twist

The judge ignored your earnest pleas
Truth was buried, lies were eased
Come on down, try to sleep
Rest your eyes stay off your feet

You can walk the moon or swim the sea
If it's not too late it'll never be
You hold the treasure in your fist
Let it go, that's the old soul twist, that old soul twist

Bang it, dang it, hang it on the wall
Throw it out the window, run and catch it before it falls
Used to go like that, now it goes like this
Time to do that old soul twist

Pressures on, money's tight
Everything will be alright
Stay awake, stay alert
Do the things you know will work

The only strength is the strength to live
The only life is the life we give
Live to give, that's the word
And all the wisdom that I've heard

Used to go, now it goes like this
That's the old soul twist

"It's cold outside, Lord help those
Lost tonight with the freezing toes
In the dark with the rain drenched clothes
She's all the way down

The sky has cleared, stars are bright
Temperature's gonna fall tonight
In the park looking for a light
She's in a hospital gown

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
It's another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'll say

Some drink wine, some are smokin' crack
This lady all alone wants none of that
In the park with a cart and sack
Afraid she's gonna drown

A choice she made not long ago
Has led to this, how could you know?
The door slammed shut, her children go
To whatever life they've found

Underneath the stars, what's it going to be?
In the house of mars, stranded by degrees
Hunger in the night, answered with a prayer
See the passing cars, there's nobody there

Now the clergy have their doubts
Are they helping lazy layabouts?
Late at night the drunken louts
Terrify the town

The cops are young, well, they're just kids
They don't know about the skids
They just do what the gentry bids
From the other end of town

Underneath the stars, who will crack the seal?
Waitin' here to die, numbers on a wheel
Figures in the dark, crouch against the wall
Out here in the park there's no one to call

Asleep in the park rain or shine
A thousand crows on the telephone line
Ask her how and she'll say fine
She's all the way down

Dew drops shot like cannonballs
Crash on paper prison walls
Her heart stops beating and her breathing stalls
She's dyin' all alone

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
In another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'd say

So now you ask what can I do?
See and know, they're just like you
You could wind up in the blue
Beneath a pauper's crown

Don't be afraid, you'll be surprised
If when you look into their eyes
You find a soulful feeling rise
You're all the way down

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
In another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'd say

And near a river down a lonely winding road
Friendly conversation
Then you read by candlelight

Every word of every story told 
Maybe you can move into the castle
Surrounded by the ivy covered walls
Find a bit of paradise

Where no one bothers you
Only time they come is when you call 

Something I never realized about the city
Once it's in your heart it's there to stay
When you close your eyes you realize
It's been there all along

Home is where you live and where you lay
Everywhere that you go it may seem funny
You can hide if you want, you can change your name 

Everywhere I look, everyone I see
Everywhere it's all the same

'Cause she's leaving you all alone
Little woman gonna make you cry
You don't ever want to say good bye
She's a lady, she'll always be Daddy's Girl

Little woman gonna break your heart
Gonna miss her when you're both apart
She's a lady, but she'll always be Daddy's Girl

She'll always be Daddy's Girl
She'll always be Daddy's Girl
She'll always be Daddy's Girl
She'll always be Daddy's Girl
She'll always be Daddy's Girl
She'll always be Daddy's Girl",6
"One more sad tomorrow
And I'm not very good at hiding my sorrow
It's not the same without you
So alone and so afraid
I thought we had it made 
What about us, what about the way
We were so in love, when we were together
I thought you'd never leave
Now I know this time you're gone forever 

[Chorus]
Only love can break your heart
Fill you with desire
And tear you all apart
Only love can make you cry
Only love knows why 

One more night without you
I'm just trying to pretend that you're coming back again
You know I never meant to doubt you, oh no
We were young and we were free
Now I can't believe this has happened to me 

What about us, what about the way
We were so in love, when we were together 

[Chorus]

Gonna be a long hard road without you
And there's one thing you should know
Tell me who will I turn to
When I get in trouble
I really don't want you to go, no 

Tell me who can I turn to
When I get in trouble
Baby please don't leave me
Can't you see you must believe me 

Only love can break your heart
Fill you with desire
And tear you down, the minute that you fall apart 

Only love can make you cry
Only love knows why, oh no
Only love can tear you down
Only love knows why, oh no 

Only love will make you cry",6
"She lays her cards out on the table
She always gets what she's going for, and a whole lot more
Got the movers and the shakers
Quaking inside their mohair shoes
After all there's nothing to lose 

[Chorus]
Cracking that whip
Making her own decisions
Taking no lip
Living with no conditions 

There's only one thing that she's missing
She never tells anybody, she's missing it more and more each night
And though she cries when she's alone
By the morning she's ready to go
She's got the light 

[Chorus]

Everything's fine
Just as long as they do it her way
Living with style
She's got it all
Hail to the queen of the masquerade ball 

And though she cries when she's alone
By the morning she's ready to go
She's got the light 

[Chorus]

Everything's fine
Just as long as they do it her way
Living with style
She's got it all
Hail to the queen of the masquerade ball",6
"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows",5
"It's every young boy's fancy
It's there hidden deep in the heart of a man
It's just a feeling
They won't ever understand

They know they gotta have one
A brand new model and it's here today
And don't you know that she's made right here in the U.S.A. 

[Chorus]
Don't ever stop trying
Don't let her get away
They don't make 'em like they used to
I think they're better than before
It's more than physical attraction
Keeps you coming back for more 

She's a home grown beauty
She's born and raised with a mind of her own
And once you find her
You'll never want to leave her alone

She's making you crazy
You can't live without her, she's here to stay
Don't you know that she lives right here in the U.S.A. 

[Chorus] 

They don't make 'em like they used to
They're so much better than before 

I'm so tired of hearing--(I'm so tired)
Some people say--(what people say)
Everything is moving much too fast
Things were better in the good old days

Let them have their opinions--(let them have...)
Never gonna change their mind--(they'll never change)
They lived a long time ago
When times were tough
And a real good woman was hard to find 

They don't make 'em like they used to
I think they're better than before
It's more than physical attraction
That keeps you coming back for more 

[Chorus] 

They don't make 'em like they used to
They're so much better than before",6
"Hey baby, you've got nothing to lose
Now's the time to slip away
Oh woman can't you see
I really want you here with me 
Hey Mama, I can make you forget
What you ever saw in him
Don't understand
Why you want to be with that man 

The time is right so take it from me
You'll find out when we're alone
Good lovin' follows good company
There's no tellin' what I'll do, when I get next to you 

Hey baby, if you look in my eyes
I won't let you get away
Oh woman don't you see
I'd rather have you here with me 

Hey Mama, don't you tell me good night
Where's your curiosity
Don't understand
Why you want to be with that man 

The time is right so take it from me
You'll find out when we're alone
Good lovin' follows good company
There's no tellin' what I'll do, when I get next to you 

I can't explain
Hope you feel the same
Want to wake up to love
I know it's true
Can't get over you
Want to wake up to love 

The night is still young
We've got nothing but time
All alone
In our own paradise 

The time is right so take it from me
You'll find out when we're alone
Good lovin' follows good company
There's no tellin' what I'll do, I just want to feel it too 

I can't explain
Hope you feel the same
Want to wake up to love
I know it's true
Can't get over you
Want to wake up to love",7
"If you see me coming up an open road
With an empty glass and a single rose
Take a turn towards the shifting light
There you'll see my shadow lost in the night

Endless flight has no directions now
To a coward's kiss from a hero's vow
If I could find the words, I'd pick up the phone
If I was half a man, I wouldn't sleep alone

Send me no more angels on a restless wind
All I ever wanted were the simple things
If a love like ours means anything
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings

Oh you shook your head like a wild horse
Beneath the southern cross in the frozen North
Oh when our bodies touched on that burning beach
I could have sworn that heaven was within our reach

Send me no more angels on a restless wind
All I ever wanted were the simple things
If a love like ours means anything
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings

Time just crawls here behind my eyes
If the scar heals, can our love survive
Life's only purpose seems so distant now
If there's a chance at all won't you show me how

Send me no more angels on a restless wind
All I ever wanted were the simple things
If a love like ours means anything
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings",5
"One big happy family
Together the rest of our lives
As far as our friends were concerned
Everything seemed right

But that's when she told me
She said me it was time to move on
Just something that she kept inside
That told me the thrill was gone

And now I can't believe
I can't believe it's over
Suddenly it's plain to see
She's leaving me and

Even a fool can see
There's nothing left between us
I knew all along something was wrong
But I did my best to deny it
And now I can't go home
She wants to be alone so
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright
Even a fool can see

There were times we had nothing
And somehow we laughed through it all
There are moments I'll never forget
And some I wouldn't care to recall

And still I can't believe
I can't believe it's over
Suddenly it's plain to see
She's doesn't need me

Even a fool can see
There's nothing left between us
I knew all along something was wrong
But I did my best to deny it
And now I can't go home
She wants to be alone so
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright
Even a fool can see

Nothing more to talk about
It's over when it's over
In the end you both stop trying
In the end it's oh so sad
And you are crying

And now I can't go home
She wants to be alone so
Tell anyone who misses me that I'm alright
Even a fool can see

Won't ya tell me that I'm alright
Even a fool like me

Woo ooo I'm alright
Even a fool can see
Whoa ooo ooo ooo",6
"In the morning light
Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever laid there thinking
Was it all a dream?
But you reach out and she's there
Every moment, everywhere
Have you ever been in love?

Have you ever felt
How far a heart can fall
Have you ever stayed up waiting
For a telephone call
Just to hear her say hello
'Cause you miss each other so
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

And when she's far away
Have you ever felt the need to stray
And tried and then discovered
It just doesn't pay
'Cause with her, you can be true
And with her, you can be you
Have you ever been in love?

Have there been times to laugh
And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

And when the night comes down
Can you call your house a home
Do you dream you're still together
And wake up alone
Have you ever been in love
The way that I'm in love
Have you ever been in love?",6
"I've seen the best of times
I've seen the worst of times
'Been around and I've taken my chances
(But) I could never be tied down
Too many questions, not enough answers 

Then I laid eyes on you
I knew right there and then
This would be more than a passing encounter
My fate is bound to yours
I've found a cause right here 

And if this is the last place God made
And yours is the last face I see
Just feeling close to you
That's good enough for me 

We've seen the best of times
We've seen the worst of times
Been through hell and high water together
Diamond bright and tear stained mem'ries
These are the times I'll remember forever 

If you believe in me, like I believe in you
Without a care for the why or the wherefore
I will be there for you
And you'll be there for me 

And If this is the last place God made
And yours is the last face I see
Just feeling close to you
It's good enough for me 

If this is the last place God made
You know it's the only place I want to be
Just feeling close to you
That's good enough for me 

If this is the last place God made
You know it's the only place I want to be
Just feeling close to you 
It's good enough for me",6
"There's a man in me who's lost his way
And he searches for his pride
He's confused by who he's told to be
Cause he feels the beast inside 

He is troubled by the changing times
And he fears his dreams have died
There's a man that's waited
Hoping to be liberated 

There's a man in me who
I want to save
Revive his dignity
Free from his cage
And release the man in me who
Cries for the day
He will be let out
And show us the way
I believe there's a man in me 

I have lived inside my mother's eyes
I have felt my father's heart
I am torn between the dark and light
But I won't be torn apart 

Cause there's a man in me who's unafraid
Who only now can feel his rage
He's been taught to hide it
But he can no longer fight it 

There's a man in me who
I want to save
Revive his dignity
Free from his cage
And release the man in me who
Cries for the day
He will be let out
And show us the way
I believe there's a man in me 

Here we are
I didn't think we'd get this far
We were overdue
When it's time
To understand the man
Then I can love
The woman in you 

There's a man that's waited
Hoping to be liberated 

There's a man in me who
I want to save
Revive his dignity
Free from his cage
And release the man in me who
Cries for the day
He will be let out
And show us the way
I believe there's a man in me",6
"Didn't want to face a long hot summer
Didn't want to spend another lonely night
Didn't want to stay until I met you

You could tell that we were made for each other
Something in the air and the time was right
Came into my life, oh, I can't forget you

I don't want to leave tomorrow
Yes, I said it all inside of a letter
That I put in your hand when we walked in the sand
Don't you understand

I don't want to go where there's no tomorrow
You go your way, I'll go mine
Each one missing what they left behind

I don't wanna go where there's no tomorrow
Help me try to make a dream come true
I don't wanna leave if I can't be with you

Wouldn't ever change a thing for a minute
Seems the water's always deeper when you're in it
That's the way it goes, not the way I planned it

I don't want to leave without you
I don't want to go if you won't follow
Told you once, tell you once again
I don't want this summer to ever end
Gonna be there when I can",5
"You and me
We were the last of the line
Young and free
We were two of a kind 

We ran the streets together
The night would last forever
Oh do you remember when 

Whatever happened to our wild ways
The hungry beat of our younger days
We swore we'd never let them get away
But so long to our wild ways 

You and me
Driving to the ocean at night
Running free
Trying to stay ahead of the light 

The road ran through the morning
Time passed without a warning sign
Oh we were the reckless kind 

Whatever happened to our wild ways
The hungry beat of our younger days
We swore we'd never let them get away
But so long to our wild ways 

Baby we could be free once again
I'll take you away from this town
You know I won't let you down
You know I won't let you down 

Whatever happened to our wild ways
The hungry beat of our younger days 

We swore we'd never let them get away
But so long to our wild ways",6
"I never thought life would be easy
Take it from me it's not easy
When you're living on your own
And now I face it (and even now I take it)
One day at a time (one step at a time) 

Then I try to rise
Each time I fall
Try to find a way
Of getting through it all 

I used to believe in you
Now I need someone else to turn to
Any though it's only a matter of time 

That when you lose the magic
Suddenly your world comes falling down
All around you
And though it seems so tragic
Even when there's no one else around
You hear the sound
Of another world falling down 

Leaving your memories behind me
Hoping that nothing reminds me
Praying that I can forget
And even now I take it
One step at a time, and now I 

Face the future eye to eye
I know it won't be easy, but I'll get by",5
"Feel your breath on my shoulder
And I know we couldn't get any closer
I don't wanna act tough, I just wanna fall in love
As we move into the night I get crazy

I don't wanna play rough I've been loving you enough
Oh, baby

Wanna stay in this moment forever
I'm gonna give you all the love that I've got
I wanna take forever tonight
Fill you up, fill you up with love
When we close the door all I need is in your eyes
I wanna take forever tonight

Touch my lips, I'm on fire
You're the only one I'll ever desire
Turn the lights down low, make the world go slow
When I'm holding you tonight it's so easy
Nothing moves me like you do when you tease me
And to rush would be a crime
I just wanna spend some time with you baby

And when I'm here beside you
I wanna see what drives you out of your mind
I never wanna leave I only wanna be with you

I wanna take forever tonight
Wanna stay in this moment forever

What did you need from me you felt we were missing
Now you never write - and you never call 

What did you want - I couldn't give
You should've told me baby I would have listened
Why did you leave - when we had it all 

And I think of you
Yes I think of you

Everywhere I go - anytime of the day
Every move I make - every word that I say
If I let myself I get carried away
When I think of you
I still think of you

I felt like one lucky
Son of a gun

And when you turned into two
I was so happy
When you said I love you

Held you in my arms so tight
I'd never forget
The best years of my life

Apple of your daddy's eye
want to be the one to hold you in the night
Apple of your daddy's eye
Oh, oh sleep tight
Don't you worry gonna be alright

I remember when you were three
You were so lovely
So very pretty

And when you turned into four
I finally realized
What God put her here for

Apple of your daddy's eye
want to be the one to hold you in the night
Apple of your daddy's eye
Oh, oh sleep tight
Don't you worry gonna be alright

If I had my way
Time would stand still
You'd stay as sweet as you are
But time waits for no one
It never will
Your gonna leave me soon enough
I'm just sad 'cause you're growing up

Held you in my arms so tight
I'd never forget
The best years of my life

Apple of your daddy's eye
want to be the one to hold you in the night
Apple of your daddy's eye
Oh, oh sleep tight
Don't you worry gonna be alright

Don't stop ever lovin' me because
You're the apple of your daddy's eye",6

Driving to the edge of town

If anyone could have a change of heart
Maybe you could change your mind
But if you're giving up - If you're letting go
Don't let me be the last to know 

Here I go again
Walking down the same old streets
I don't want to see anybody
I want to be discreet 

I'm a firm believer
And I once believed in you
But now I can't believe all the things
You're putting me through

I'm not sleeping too well
I'm not doing what I know I can - I can't help myself
Only time will tell

"Some say it's just the nature of the beast
When you love somebody so passionately
Time has a way of stealing
That raging fire feeling
Leaving the ashes laying at your feet

Those fools of little faith will never know
That higher place two hearts can go
Where time is standing still
And love will burn until
The heavens and the earth have come and gone

This fire inside for you is constant as the northern star
And you will be forever in my heart
As long as there's a river searching for an endless sea
I will always love you
Faithfully

Tonight we'll raise a glass to lovers
Across the ages
We'll hold each other
And toast to the day
When history's said and done
And we still stand as one
Some things were never meant to fade away

This fire inside for you is constant as the northern star",6

Very unsuspecting
You caught my heart
Unprotecting me

Life was free and easy
You came along to me
Soft and breezy

[Chorus]
And for the first time in my life
I know what it's like to be a happy man
Happy man
And for the first time in my life
You've given me something I can't understand
Now that I'm a happy man 

Be with me now
Love me forever
Leaving you lady
Is something that I'd never do
I've fallen in love with you 

All of my life it seems I have waited
Now I can say all these words I have stated are true
I've fallen in love with you
I've fallen in love with you

I know exactly what to do
And if I'm temperamental
You calm me down and you pull me through

We are the lucky ones
We have one another
When the end of the day has come
I return to you 

Life can be so demanding
Sometimes it's hard to make it through
It's love and understanding
You give to me, I give to you

Our own fairy tale
Our favorite bedtime story
One that we won't forget
We fell in love
We knew from the start
We'd always be together
The first time that we met
Can't forget

All alone in the setting sun
I'll have you and you'll have me",6
"The whole world is talkin', drownin' out my voice
How can I hear myself with all this noise
But all this confusion just disappears
When I find a quiet place where I can hear

One clear voice callin' out for me to listen
One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom
Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'
If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice

I'm always searchin' for which path to take
Sometimes I'm so afraid to make mistakes
From somewhere inside me stronger than my fears
Just like the sound of music to my ears

One clear voice callin' out for me to listen
One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom
Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'
If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice

"Where are those happy days
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you
But you have closed your mind

I wish I understood
It used to be so nice
Used to be so good 

So when you're near me
Darling can't you hear me
S.O.S.
The love you gave me
Nothing else can save me
S.O.S. 

When you're gone
How can I even try to go on
When you're gone
Though I try how can I carry on
You seem so far away - though you are standing near
You made me feel alive but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out
I wish I understood
What happened to our love
It used to be so good",7
"Since you went away
Can't face the day
Just can't face it on my own

Lying awake half the night without sleeping
Hopelessly thinking of you
Here in my heart I have to admit it's true
I'm still getting over you 

I begged you not to leave
I asked you not to run away
Oh but you wouldn't listen
I couldn't change your mind

So you left me here behind
Oh how I miss your touch
And your tender kissing
Lying awake half the night without sleeping

Hopelessly thinking of you
Deep down inside I hate to admit it's true
But I'm still getting over you 

Lying awake half the night without sleeping
Hopelessly thinking of you
Here in my heart I have to admit it's true
There's nothing I can do
I'm still getting over you",5

When you turn out the lights
I want to be there

In the middle of nowhere

I want to hold you 

I want to be there in the morning
I want to touch you
'Cause you know tonight
There's nowhere else that I would rather be

I'm not the same when you're not here with me
Close your eyes and say a little prayed
And baby I'm gonna be there 

I want to be there
I want to be there
want to be there in the morning
Oh, I want to be there",5

Just to watch you sleep, hear each breath you take.
When the morning lights your face,
I just want to hold you, and forget the day.
I live and breathe your every touch
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much? 

When you look at me across the crowded room,
Suddenly I want to be alone with you.
I hang on every word that leaves your lips,
Anticipate the moment when I feel your kiss.
Enough of you is not enough.
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much? 

For so long, I've been trying to believe,
That someday, you'll fall as deep as me.
But it's just not there, love isn't always fair. 

Would you want the best for me,
And I hope I find the kind of love you can't feel for me.
Could you find it in your heart,
To end this thing right now before it's gone too far
Let me go and give me up
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much?
Do you love me that much?",7
"All through my wandering years
I always said I was biding my time
But alone in the dark I'd face my fears
That no other heart would come to mine 

At first when you found me
It took me a while 'til I realized
Why I felt weak when you were around me
Why I couldn't speak when I looked in your eyes 

All this time I've been searching
Until you, I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven
Watching over me 

Oh wherever you go
Invisible hands reach over the miles
For every wish you make to the stars
There's one silent kiss I send to the sky 

All this time I've been searching
Until you I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven
Watching over me 

Everything has changed
Since you came my way
Cause you put the color
In a world of grey
And you make the love
That carries me away 

All this time I've been searching
Until you I was lost in my dreams
And I never knew that love could feel like heaven
Watching over me
Feels like heaven
Watching over me",6
"Love like a road that never ends
How it leads me back again
To heartache
I'll never understand
Darling I put my heart up on a shelf
'Till the moment was right and I told myself
Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
It will be with you

Now as I look into your eyes
Well I wonder if it's wise
To hold you
Like I've wanted to before
Tonight oh I was thinking that you might
Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Oh oh oh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
(It will be with you)

Next time I'm gonna follow through
And if it drives me crazy
I will know better why
The next time I try

Next time I fall in love
I'll know better what to do
Next time I fall in love
Oh oh oh
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
The next time I fall in love
the next time I fall in love",6
"Don't know when she started changing
Don't know how it's come to this
Seems like yesterday she was in my arms, begging for a kiss
Now the winds of change are blowin'
And they're taking her away
I will do my best not to hold her back,
But there's nothing more to say 

She doesn't need me
She's gonna leave me
She needs some time on her own
I should have told her
Now I can't hold her
Wish it could be like before
But she doesn't need me anymore 

It's so hard to watch believe me
It's so hard to be alone
I just hope and prey that there'll come a day,
She'll find the road back home 

She doesn't need me
She's gonna leave me
She needs some time on her own
I should have told her
Now I can't hold her
Wish it could be like before
But she doesn't need me anymore 

If I pretend to be happy, I'd only be fooling myself
'Cause here in my heart I know that I'm dying
And it's tearing me apart, baby I'm crying 

I should have told her
Now I can't hold her
Wish it could be like before
But she doesn't need me now 

Wish it could be like before
But she doesn't need me anymore",6
"(Don't go, please don't go)
If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go
And if you leave me now, you'll take away the very heart of me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby please don't go 
A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away? 

We've come to far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret things we said today 

A love like ours is love that's hard to find
How could we let it slip away? 

We've come to far to leave it all behind
How could we end it all this way?
When tomorrow comes and we'll both regret things we said today 

If you leave me now, you'll take away the biggest part of me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, baby, please don't go",5
"I am so in love with you
I just can't deny it
Everybody knows I can't deny it
Everybody knows

You can read me like a book
Just like a fortune teller
Everybody needs a fortune teller
Telling you the very truth

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me a love that's taking me higher
It just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You bring out the best in me
With love and understanding
Anytime I need some understanding
You are always there

And if I ever lose my way
You're always there to guide me
Anyone can see you're here inside me
Anyone can see it

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me a love that's taking me higher
It just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You fill me with hope
With love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
It just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

This is our time, we have it all
We have a way of knowing if we're heading for a fall
We'll work it out and get it right
And when I get home to you
You're such a sight for my poor eyes

This is our time, we have it all
When I come home at night
You're such a sight for my poor eyes

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me a love that's taking me higher
It just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You fill me with hope
With love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
It just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You bring me feelin'
You bring me fire
You give me a love that's taking me higher
It just goes to prove
What one good woman can do

You fill me with hope
With love and devotion
You taught me how to show my emotion
It just goes to prove
What one good woman can do",7
"She said she always loved this time of year
And how they used to celebrate when he was here
Then he went away and nothing more to say
He's not coming home
She's gonna be alone for the holidays

She wrote down every word in her diary
She reads it now and then
To remind her of how it used to be
He's not here today, there's nothing more to say
He's not coming home
She's gonna be alone for the holidays

She cries all night on Christmas Eve
She just gets by on Christmas day
She's lost her will but kept her faith
But he's not coming home
She's gonna be alone for the holidays

She cries all night on New Year's Eve
She just gets by on New Year's Day
She's lost her will but kept her faith
He's never coming home
She's gonna be alone alone for the holidays

"Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",6
