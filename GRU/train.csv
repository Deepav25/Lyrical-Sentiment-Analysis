"No, no
I ain't ever trapped out the bando
But oh Lord, don't get me wrong
I know a couple niggas that do
I'm from a place where everybody knows your name
They say I gotta watch my attitude
When they see money, man they all start actin' strange
So fuck with the ones that fuck with you
They can never say I'm brand new

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular
I've been lovin' 'em thick, life is spectacular
I spend like I'ma die rich, nigga I'm flexin', yeah
Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday

I see all of these wanna-be hot R&B singers
I swear you all sound the same
They start from the bottom, so far from the motto
You niggas'll never be Drake
Shout out to OVO
Most of them prolly don't know me though
I stay in the cut, I don't fuck with no
Body but I D, that's a pun on No I.D
When nobody know my name
Runnin' for my dream wasn't hard to do
You break bread, I swear they all pull out a plate
Eat with the ones who starved with you
If I'm winnin' then my crew can't lose

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular
I've been lovin' 'em thick, life is spectacular
I spend like I'ma die rich, nigga I'm flexin', yeah
Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday

I heard since you got money
You changed, you're actin' funny
That's why I gets on my lonely
You be lovin' when change is a hobby
Who do you dress when you ain't got nobody?

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular
I've been lovin' 'em thick, life is spectacular
I spend like I'ma die rich, nigga I'm flexin', yeah
Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday",4
"The drinks go down and smoke goes up, I feel myself, got to let go
My cares get lost up in that crowd that go up, up and away yo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

Ain't kill my vibe, don't blow my high, don't doubt that he from the band though
I'm listening to this song, now I'm up up and away yo

Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way

When I'm out at night, I chase neon lights
All of my thoughts start to echo, yeah they start to echo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

So I'ma roll the dice, and I hope that I
Don't take more than I can handle, much than I can handle

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die
Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die
Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace

No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace

"She don't live on planet Earth no more
She found love on Venus, that's her word
Said she needed space, time to explore

Is it might fault that you're broken, is it my fault that your'e high?
You caught me cheating with my ex-girlfriend, but instead of calling me I caught her

I was like ""man, oh shit, my new girl fuckin' with my old chick""
We both bad, so she switched, packed her bags, said she had to take a trip
To the otherside, the otherside, the otherside
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, to the otherside

Can we get back to how it was before?
If I can't have you, at least show me what's in store
And what I've made is [?] come forward more
Then we can go on and on and on and on

Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low
Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low

Baby I'm surprised you picked up this late at night
And I'm not tryna start a fight
But I hate the way we ended and the fact you got me cheated
I hate these new beginnings even though I am the reason
The only thing I love right now is you

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

[Hook 1]
I'm just trippin' off that Grigio
It sucks to see that you don't feel me though
Pour me a glass and let my feelings blow

Aw baby, pour me a drink to get over you
Aw baby, aw baby, I ain't no drinker but it's gettin' me though

Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low
Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low
Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low
Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin'

I don't know why your father never like me
Was it because of my [?]boy ways and this white tee? Your eye
Always thought your momma was a winner
Considering her only stayed together after all those years
You think that we could learn from them

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

Nights like this, we should be trippin' off that Grigio
Telling me secrets that nobody knows
Pour us a shot and cut the music on
Now let's get started, cut these fuckin' lights off
Aw baby, I'ma pour a drink for you
Aw baby, aw baby, I'ma pour a drink for you

Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low

"I see a midnight panther, so gallant and so brave
I found, I found the answers in the thunder and the rain

"Dieses ist lange her.
Da ich deine schmalen Hande nahm
Dieses ist lange her.
Schlugst die runden Augen auf, 
Dieses ist lange her.

Am Abend, 
Wenn wir auf dunklen Pfaden gehn, 
Erscheinen unsere bleichen Gestalten. 

Wenn uns durstet, 
Trinken wir die weissen Wasser des Teichs, 
Die Susse unserer traurigen Kindheit. 

Estorbene
Ruhen wir unterm Gebusch, 
Schaun den grauen Mowen zu. 

Fruhlingsgewolke 
Streigen uber die Stadt,
Die der Monche edlere Zeiten schweigt. 

Doch wenn dunkler Wohllaut 
Die Seele heimsucht, 
Erscheinst do Weisse in des Freundes Landschaft. 

Dieses ist lange her.
Da ich deine schmalen Hande nahm
Dieses ist lange her.
Schlugst die runden Augen auf, 
Dieses ist lange her.",5
"A child is born
Out of the womb of a mother

Blind passion

This unwanted life

During its whole life

Oh my dark friend 
Can you give me an answer

What is it for 
This poor life 
We live down here

Is there a power all above 
A person so called God 
So called God 
Who plans our life 
Or is it our free will 
The creator of our life 
Are we responsible

Deep blue and the sun is shining

There have to be some clouds

Deep inside
And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Is about to rise

Please come and calm this anger
You're the one to calm this anger
And if you can't calm this anger

"I was walking through the night
Suddenly I remarked a sound in the winds
An angel like voice singing a tale

Through the cold and stormy night
Flies an angel
The black angel
White skin, red lips and long black hair,
Her wing is broken
The guardian angel

Listening breathless to her voice
Which has touched me right there in my heart
I felt the tears run down my face

Through the cold and stormy night
Flies an angel
The black angel
White skin, red lips and long black hair,
Her wing is broken
The guardian angel

The storm drags on her clothes
Like an invisible warrior
Her wing broke with a sound
So disgusting that it froze my heart
Her voice became weaker
Losing this fight of blackness

Why can't I hold you now

You just told me on the phone
Bad news I can't believe they're true
Fate is so cruel to you it seems
It caught you at your weakest point
Nothing left of your whole world
Besides chaos and smoking ruins
You thought there's nothing more to lose
You're wrong and he presents the proof

Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend

Why can't I hear you breath
Why can't I hold you now

You will need all of your strength
I hope that you can carry on
You fought the shadows of the ghosts
Now he's the one you will fight next
Knocking at your door as if
He is a guest you like to see
Don't let him in, just push him back
He is not welcome in your house

Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend

To leave your prison
Your heart lies in chains
And who will break them
Your heart lies in chains

Maybe you will find a way to forgive yourself
Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Maybe one day you will find the peace for your mind
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

It tears you all apart
Restrained emotions
You're denying all your feelings
And it will break you
You're denying all your feelings

Maybe you will find a way to forgive yourself
Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Maybe one day you will find the peace for your mind
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

"He took my soul
Took my soul
In his hands
My mind got dark
Mind got dark

To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows
Then I laid my soul into your hands

Said sweet words
With his voice
He seduced me softly
Seduced you
With his voice

When did I begin
To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows

Of my soul
Since then I feel
My mind's lost in madness

Lost my soul
In the dark
Lost my mind

Has gone
The autumn leaves
Start to fall

Yesterday I was touched by the breath of winter
His cold fingers searched for my heart
But in my heart I felt the warmth of this summer
So the first snowflakes melted away

The long summer
Has gone
The autumn leaves
Start to fall

I felt the world hold its breath
And everything turned slower
All was silent, softened by the snow
The world is going to sleep now
In a freezing white coat
But I know what I will see its rebirth

The world's breath is slow
Silently
The first snowflakes fall

As darkness sunk into our hearts

A silent wall of doom darkening the sky

We'll be born again and rise
Now that I have found a way

To salvation I know I will be
So much stronger than before

Nothing will ever break me
And it's gonna be enough
To fill me up
And it's gonna be enough
For my restless mind

Phoenix from the ashes
Our wounds will be healed
Phoenix from the ashes
We'll be born again and rise

We will rise
From the ashes",6

Their own wings and fly

They will fall and die

Wake up, stand up and join the keepers of the truth
Oh brother
Wake up, stand up, they are too weak alone it seems
My brother
Wake up, stand up, remember the promise of our youth

We will follow him to the sky so high
We will never fall, we will never die
You're an eagle in the sky
You know how to use your wings to fly
But if you rise to high
You will fall and die

With the flash of your burning eyes I know
That you're the only one

Can't hold out forever and oh, oh oh

Me dio dos luceros, que cuando los abro,
Perfecto distingo lo negro del blanco
Y en el alto cielo su fondo estrellado
Y en las multitudes el hombre que yo amo

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el oido que en todo su ancho
Graba noche y dia, grillos y canarios,
Martillos, turbinas, ladridos, chubascos,
Y la voz tan tierna de mi bien amado

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado el sonido y el abecedario;
Con el las palabras que pienso y declaro:
Madre, amigo, hermano, y luz alumbrando
La ruta del alma del que estoy amando

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la marcha de mis pies cansados;
Con ellos anduve ciudades y charcos,
Playas y desiertos, montanas y llanos,
Y la casa tuya, tu calle y tu patio

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me dio el corazon que agita su marco
Cuando miro el fruto del cerebro humano,
Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tanto
Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto
Asi yo distingo dicha de quebranto,
Los dos materiales que forman mi canto,
Y el canto de ustedes que es mi mismo canto,
Y el canto de todos que es mi propio canto
Gracias a la vida que me ha dado tant",5

Far from your tranquil altitude
Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream

A heart that stops when you pass by
Only to cause me pain

Just to feel a little over zero, a little over
Now that I'm sadness
Now that I'm weakness
Gonna walk like it's for ever
Gonna walk because it could save me
For my fragility could kill me

'N just live my life
Yeah I want to wake up
'N find out I'm alive
A saint for each bone
Would be magical
It would feel so all consuming
That I'd burn up just like paper
And my serenity it would kill me so

Here she comes
You'd better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two
It's true

It's not hard to realise
Just look into her false colored eyes
She'll build you up just to put you down
What a clown!

Everybody knows
The things she does to please
She's just a little tease
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks

You're put down in her book
And you are number 37, have a look!
She's going to smile to make you frown
What a clown!

Little boy, she's from the street
So before you start you're already beat
She's going to play you for a fool
You can see it's true

Everybody knows the things
The things she does to please
She's just... just a little tease.. oh, she is just..
See the way she walks
Do you hear the way she talks?

Everybody knows the things

"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the lord
But you don't really care for music, do you
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah...

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learnt from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

So I just close my ears, my eyes 
And I feel like shutting my mouth

But I saw you were in need of help
That is when my heart just melts
When I see sorrow in your eyes
There's nowhere you can hide the lies

I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
How you just lost your path and each fear that makes you act
I know why you're trapped, what makes you feel like that
How you just lost your path and each fear that holds you back

How strange it feels to rearrange

I've been waiting for so long
Fighting frustration

You came along
With no explanation
I'm not leaving without you
You are my destination

Waste your time on me
Watch the hours fly by like they do in dreams
Waste your time on me
Both of us can stop tryin' to say the right thing

Now it's only the two of us
What a wonderful mess we are making
Scared of the ones we trust
Our hearts are tired of breaking
And having you near me
Is as far as I want you to be

Waste your time on me
Watch the hours fly by like they do in dreams
Waste your time on me
Both of us can stop tryin' to say the right thing
Waste your time on me
Together we can leave behind the lines of enemies
Come waste your time on me

It's my love and your love
Our good love, our hard love
To come by
It's my love and your love
Our good love, our hard love
To come by

Waste your time on me
Watch the hours fly by like they do in dreams
Waste your time on me
Both of us can stop tryin' to say the right thing
Waste your time on me
Together we can leave behind the lines of enemies
Waste your time on me
Waste your time on me
Waste your time on me
Waste your time
Come waste your time on me
Come waste your time on me

It's my love and your love
Our good love, our hard love
To come by",6
"Nothing can give us back this time we've wasted

Pray we'll learn to let go

Mother you could not let me go 
Still you couldn't keep me from pain 
Keep me away from it all 
Father it was all out of love 
But tell me why it tears me apart 
Why do we end up with the hurt 

So tired of hearing that time fixes everything 
Mistakes keep repeating I can't make sense of it all 
You're my palm reader, wanna know every secret 
I can't stop trying to change you
If you would take me for who I am 

Can you take me for who I am? 
Can you take me for who I am? 

Can you take me for who I am? 
Can you take me for who I am? 

Mother you could not let me go 
Still you couldn't keep me from pain 
Keep me away from it all 
Father it was all out of love 
Tell me why it tears me apart 
Why do we end up with the hurt

Mother I keep letting you down 
Tell me why it's never enough 
I end up with nothing at all 
Father you would not let me fall 
But why are you afraid to look down 
Afraid we'll end up with the hurt 
Mother why do we act so cold?

The difference it would have made 
To realize we were the same 
And all the good we could have done 
If we had felt like we were one 
You're my palm reader, wanna know all my secrets 
I could stop trying to change you, can you take me for who I am? 

Mother you could not let me go 
Still you couldn't keep me from pain 
Keep me away from it all

"Isn't it rich?
Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?
Losing my timing this late
in my career?
And where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

That brings this sensation, oh no

A world where roses bloom

And when you speak
Angels sing from above
Every day words
Seem to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose

I thought that love was just a word
They sang about in songs I heard
It took your kisses to reveal
That I was wrong, and love is real

Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

I see la vie en rose

Cause baby it's okay
You know I love ya

Put the slow jam on, put the slow jam on

It's my gift to let ya know what I'm gonna do
Spread the dough with extra care, add a little spices everywhere
Steam the meat with wine and juices, turn the heat up no excuses
With the eggs, the pears, the candies
Taste the flavors, make sure it's better

Turn the lights down low, pull my shirt up slow
Open the buttons one by one and watch it come undone

"How do you explain this funny feeling deep inside?
Makes me smile when I'm lonely, comforts me when I'm sad
(How do you) explain this sweet, sweet smile on my face
That just keeps (getting better) with each passing day?
For so (long) I didn't (know) I was searching in all the wrong places

(Thinking if I) spent more money than I could
(If I) worked harder than I should
Always having friends to feel good (I'd be happier)
Losing my breath in the hustle
Just stressin' over nothin'
Forgetting the real joys that lie in the simple things

How do you explain when there's more month at the end (of the money)?
Your situations tell (you to worry), but you see the flowers in bloom
(How do you) explain the soft caress on your face
That tells you it'll get better with each passing day?
For so (long) I did not know I was looking in all the wrong places

(Thinking if I) played more games then I could
(If I) worried more than I should
Spinnin' my wheels with the lover that meant me no good
Losing my breath in the hustle
Just stressin' over nothin'
Forgetting the real pleasures that lie in the simple things

Mama calling, daddy calling to see if I'm okay
The fresh air I breathe, enough food to eat
A warm place to sleep at night are the simple things",6

Love me like you love me
I remember how it used to be
There was no stronger love
And now I can't believe,
I was only too blind to see
That your love was inside of me
And now I don't have anything at all

Every night I think, as time just passes by
How I lived your love and how you made me cry
Now that I find I don't know what to do
My life is so empty, so empty alone without you

Without you, without you
I don't know what to do without you boy
Without you,
My love is in your hands
There's nothing left to live for
There's nothing left to do, without you

Every night that I sleep, I sleep with a fantasy
That you're here, its just you and me
Like it always was
But then I'm left to see that it was only a memory
And what's left is for me to be
Alone without your love",6

Are these your hands holdin' mine

For the first time I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see

When you're lookin' back at me
Now I understand why love is
Love is for the first time
Can this be real, can this be true

Am I the person I was this morning
And are you the same you
It's all so strange how can it be
All along this love was right in front of me

For the first time I am looking in your eyes
For the first time I'm seein' who you are
I can't believe how much I see
When you're lookin' back at me

Now I understand why love is
Love is for the first time
Such a long time ago
I had given up on findin' this emotion ever again

But you live with me now
Yes I've found you some how
And I'VE never been so sure
And for the first time I am looking in your eyes

For the first time I'm seein' who you are
Can't believe how much I see

It keeps me alive 
Alive

Like so many friends we've lost along the way 
And I know eventually we'll be together 
One sweet day

Assumed you'd always be there 
I, I took your presence for granted 
But I always cared 
And I miss the love we shared

Although the sun will never shine the same 
I'll always look to a brighter day 

Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep 
You will always listen as I pray 

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven

So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray

Than you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you
Than live in this pain and misery

They say time will
Make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows
And turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down
And once again you my friend are nowhere to be found
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say

Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away
Walk away

To men who didn't want me anymore
Why they didn't tell me before
I have never been sure

And I sat and listened for hours
To boys that I'm not sure I liked
My evenings have passed me by

I have made myself a fool
In the company of men
I have cried in the night
With no light and then done it again

And they always think 
All I want is to stay
When what I really want
Is to get my fix and then get away

Now I don't want to be popular
And I don't want to be liked anymore
I don't want to be one of the beautiful people
Cause beautiful people are boring

I've given blowjobs on couches
To men who didn't want me anymore

And sober days alone

And down the end of the fire",6

Last night last week

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say
I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say

I'm in trouble 'cause I've been watching
Watching in your bedroom window
It's the skin I'm catching
Maybe I'll see you around tomorrow

Well I seek him in candlelight
Why do I seek
I can love his body and I don't have to speak
Well I stood by his shoulder and I blew on his fave
In his eyes were the pastures of a much greener place

But I think that stitches will mend him
And his feet choose a path that they know
Looking from his bedroom window and falling in love

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say
But I was dragged down to a level of dismay

I'm in trouble 'cause I've been watching
Watching from your bedroom window
That's the train I'm catching
And I don't want to see you alone no more",6

And the world was back to front
There was sunshine in the evenin'
And the moon came out for lunch

At least we'd always know where we'd be goin' to
We could talk till we forget how to talk

And we could learn to laugh again
Like when we were children
We could learn to dance again
Like nobody is watchin'

If everyone was gettin' young
There'd be a smile on your face
If all the friends that passed away
Came back to this place

We'd be puttin' down the daisies
Drinkin' milk and feelin' lazy
There's no sense in any senses
What's the use in independence?

We could play of the tears that came
We could walk till we forget how to walk
And cool till we forget anything at all

And we would laugh again
Like when we were children
We could learn to dance again
Like nobody is watchin'

We could learn to look right
Into each others eyes
'Cause we got nothin' to hide

We got nothin' but to laugh again
Like when we were children
Like when we were children

Will you come backwards with me
Backwards with me?

Front to back, back to front
Will you come backwards with me
Backwards with me?

Of anybody checking their face,
In the shade of my glasses,
One way ticket on the fast train,

I could maybe read a novel,
To push away the trouble,
That sits in the pit of my tummy,
But I know that it will find me,
When I finish the last page.

An empty hand I wave goodbye,
I feel a tickle in my eye.

No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey, 
No hand held in mine,
No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey,
No hand held in mine.

Will I always feel it more,
On a day when there's a storm,
Or a raincloud, so dangerous and lonely,
No one ever told me,
That the darkness is my fault.

And I'm looking out the window,
And losing both my dimples,
As they enter the ends of my smile,
'Cause I am a thousand miles,
From the place I need to go.

And empty hand I wave goodbye,
I feel a tickle in my eye.

No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey, 
No hand held in mine,
No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey,

Because I'm missing how you found me
I can't afford a bigger world but, baby, I'm reliable
I'll never go
If you find me, find me, find me, find me

Because I'm missing how you found me
If anybody has a key to spare a little dream for me
I'll let it be
That you find me, find me, finally found me

I gotta get up
I gotta get up
I gotta get up
I gotta get up

So when you see me in your favorite spot
Just remember I could give you a lot
I came to see you when there's no use pretendin'
Let's hope it's a happier ending

Because I'm missing, yeah, you'll find me
I can't afford a bigger world but, baby, I'm reliable
I'll never go
If you find me, find me, find me, find me

Because I'm missing and you'll find me
If anybody has a key to spare a little dream for me
I'll let it be
That you finally, finally, finally found me

To dinner tonight
We can grow vegetables
Underneath our skylight

Clickin' these downloads
Everyday has it's price
We can lounge on our couch
And listen to our 45's

So take your Dollar, your Yen
Those Euros I can't spend
I won't get down with no Pounds
Never need to leave this house

Don't need your moneybox
'Cause I got lots and lots
Of what I need right here
Right here with you, my dear

Don't need a cash machine
To make our days happy
So do me a favor
Don't jingle your change sir
Happy for me, happy for you
Lovey, lovey, lovey-love

Instead of goin'
To the movies tonight
There's no shame in us playin'
Best of that Sega Mega Drive

Hand me your trousers
You got holes in your knees
It's no fuss, patch them up
Forget about that shoppin' spree

So take your Dollar, your Francs
Your Rupees, your Peso
I won't get down with no Pounds
Never need to leave this house

Don't need your moneybox

Of what I need right here
Right here with you, my dear

Don't have your moneybox
It's not much of a loss
All that dough just goes to waste
'Cause you're worth more anyway

Don't need to travel
'Round London tonight
We can play Monopoly
Buy Mayfair in our own time

So take your Dollar, your Baht
I couldn't give a penny
That's enough, give it out
Never need to leave this house

Don't need your moneybox
'Cause I got lots and lots
Of what I need right here
Right here with you, I know

I'm so happy you came here
You went from 'Every man'
To 'Every man savior'

When we all took to Everest
We were lookin' for change, sir
More those who start to open
The cycle has now been broken

First drop and you get up
There's a pile of dirty laundry
I know you'll clean it up
You're the man to do it for me

I trust your judgment
I like the things you say
It's common sense
I could take three times a day

Oh, Mr Medicine
I will take anything
What do you recommend?

Oh, Mr Medicine
I need my vitamins
Will I feel better then?

Oh, Mr Medicine
I feel so much better
My friend's a pessimist
But you still impress her

If you need evidence
Then I'll write you a letter
I'll lick the stamp and post it
Just so that you can notice

First drop and you get up
There's a pile of dirty laundry
I know you'll clean it up
You're the man to do it for me

And then I saw
That the patient has improved
Calling sick
Has become a lame excuse

Oh, Mr Medicine
I will take anything
What do you recommend?

Oh, Mr Medicine
I need my vitamins
Will I feel better then?

This untidy table's turning
You used the best detergent
Now it's shiny, it's not dirty
And we know that it is working

Oh, Mr Medicine

Until everyone joined in the chase,

The sirens going off in a police car

I forget, I forget to be cool, cool, cool
I try my best to not get arrested by you, you, you

Along the piano wall I wanted,
Didn't think you'd hear a wrong note,
I'm like a pencil load and blunt,
And writing in a bolder font,
And I'm steady losing your boat

Caught in a rush, taking it slow
On Euston road

Spending the time, stuck at the lights
Thinking of you, passenger side
At least we got the radio
Caught up in Euston road

I guess you never set out to be sitting here where I am
Could be tooting on your horn in a mini or a 4x4

Something bad happens and it crawls up and hits us hard
I find that your all that matters babe
When life just wont behave

Sorting through my memories

Where we were meant to be

I can't throw it away
School reports and birthdays cards
Feels like yesterday
Clip on diamantes
Makes me think of Friday nights
Leaving after class with me on the back of your bike

Because you make me feel a way that no man ever could,
Cause while they'll break my heart, break my heart,
I know you never would

I know that things will never change,
I'll always be a fool for fairytales,
Yes I'm a hopeful kind of dame,
So I need you when things fail

Oh you know who,
Will leave you nothing but those heavy aches and pains,
But I can rely on you,
To give me something that no one can take away

Because you make me feel a way that no man ever could,
Cause while they'll break my heart, break my heart,
I know you never would

You do what no man can, no man can,
They'll leave me in the ocean,
And you'll pull me back to land,
You do what no man, no man can,
They'll leave me in the ocean,
Fragile and broken,
When you throw the rope in

Because you make me feel a way that no man ever could,
'Cause while they'll break my heart, break my heart,
I know you never would

Because you make me feel a way that no man ever could,
'Cause while they'll break my heart, break my heart,
I know you never would",5
"From California to London town,
I will hold it down,

If you're gonna say it's over now,
I'm not used to taking it from you,
And bringing it back to me somehow

What's the point in life without it,
This world, we could run it, yeah we could run it

Everyday, everyday that we're apart
What can I say?
When I know I should be living every second like it's my last
What we have is amazing babe
But it comes and goes like an aeroplane
I'm done with small doses
Dipping my toes in
I'm about to dive from the white cliffs of Dover

Sometimes I wish I was Jesus
I'd get my Airmax on and run across the sea for you
Some nights I just need to see you
And cuddle in your arms, your arms
I got a little bit of a lot
But a little bit is not enough, not enough no
Sometimes I wish I was Jesus
I'd get my Airmax on max on

I'm coming your way
I don't care what I'd have to exchange for you
If I knock on your door
You won't have time to open it before I make love to you
Yes it's all about quality, true
But I need bigger quantity too
Done with small doses
Dipping my toes in
I'm about to run run run across the ocean

Sometimes I wish I was Jesus
I'd get my Airmax on and run across the sea for you
Some nights I just need to see you
And cuddle in your arms, your arms
I got a little bit of a lot
But a little bit is not enough, not enough no
Sometimes I wish I was Jesus
I'd get my Airmax on max on

I'm hoping for, a miracle
I really need to see my fella
A little boat, with a telescope
Or maybe I can get there if
I get my Airmax on max on
Tie my laces up tight, maximum
I'm a get my Airmax on max on
And run across the sea for you

"Many years ago he looked out through a glass-less window.
All that he could see was Babylon.
Beautiful green fields and dreams,
And learn to measure the stars.
But there was a worry in his heart.

He said,
How could it come to this?
I'm really worried about living.
How could it come to this?
Yeah I really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

Then there came a day.
It moved out 'cross the Mediterranean.
Came to western isles and the freak young men.
And with their silver beards they laughed
At the unknown universe.
They could sit and guess God's name.

But they said,
How could it come to this?
We're really worried about living.
How could it come to this.
Yeah, we really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

Then there followed days of Kings, Empires and revolution.
Blood just looks the same when you open the veins.
But sometimes it was faith, power or reason as the cornerstone.
But the furrowed brow has never left his face.

He said,
How could it come to this?
We've been living in a landslide!
How could it come to this?
Yeah, we really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

Then there came a day, man packed up,
Flew off from the planet.
He went to the moon,
Now he's out in space,
Hey, fixing all the problems.
He comes face to face with God.

How could it come to this?
I'm really worried 'bout my creation.
How did it comes to this?
You 're really killing me, you know.
It isn't just today?
Is it like today?
Is it like today?

"Beautiful world circling infinitely
Fragment of sun marbled in blue

Turning in time and tuned like a symphony
Beautiful stars beautiful view
Beautiful world intricate web of design
Shadow and light playing out on the land
Billions of years come down to a point in time
Setting the stage for the folly of man

Pitiful man

Beautiful trees breathing the air alive
Beautiful leaves trembling and dry
Beautiful bees moving from flower to hive
Beautiful seas mirroring sky

And you came just in time, just in time
Save this heart from black and white

To tremble in my own, to brush my cheek and take me back again

To make me calm and peaceful when I wake

Maybe I'd remember what it was, what it was, what it was

I told him to love me more than his bone
He ran efter a milk truck and never came back home",6

To the beach in Malibu

It always does, always does
Time will let the sparrow sing
We're safe as one, we're safe in love
Time will bring you back again
Moon by moon and inch by inch
Tie the bow at the end
Safe as one, we're safe in love

Time will bring you back around

Take me to a wishing well
Throw us in and sink us down
Time will tidy up the mess
Day by day and inch by inch
Tell us never to forget
The light below and the light within

You mustn't try to push the planets 'round
It's enough to put your next foot on the ground
'Cause after all you know we all fall down, we all fall down
You shouldn't try to rearrange the cosmos
Just gotta keep a steady eye on the telescope
'Cause in the end you know we all fall down, we all fall down
'Cause after everything we all fall down, we all fall down

Time will bring the sun once more
This I know, this I'm sure
Show us what we're waiting for
Bring you back to my door
Time will bring you back around
Never doubt, never doubt
Turn the echo back around
Note by note, sound by sound
Time will will bring us back, time will bring us back

No more good times here I crave
Place the stones at my head and feet
And tell them all I've gone to sleep

When I die, oh bury me deep
Down at the end of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old Number Nine
As she comes rolling by

When I die, oh bury me deep

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Blue moon!

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",6

That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt claps of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still",6

When I'm close to you, dear

My arms fold about you
You know, darling, why
So in love with you am I

In love with the night mysterious
The night when you first were there
In love with my joy delirious
When I knew that you could care

So taunt me and hurt me
Deceive me, desert me
I'm yours 'til I die
So in love
So in love
So in love with you, my love, am I",7

There's a new day dawnin', that belongs to you and me.

"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",5
"Poinciana, your branches speak to me of love
Pale moon is casting shadows from above

Within me, there grows a rhythmic beat.

Love is everywhere, it's magic perfume fills the air
To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care!

Poinciana, though skies may turn from blue to gray,
My love will live forever and a day.

""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings

But a fool can have her charms

Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old situation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this crazy situation
Has me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A whimpering, simpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I lost my heart, but what of it
She is cold I agree
She might laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, bring spring to her
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I",6

When everything's been said.
No need for fancy cards or flowery prose

They make us feel less bad.
No need for long, drawn-out explaining 
How and when, and why, this love came to an end
No need to to tell me so sincerely
You still want to be my friend.

It's a goodbye song
A little bitter, but it's sweet
You always wanted one
It comes a little late, but it's complete
It's from the heart
Please remember: I love you dearly
Although we have to part.

No need to gather up the evidence 
To justify the emptiness inside
No need to pray and turn for guidance to the Providence:
It simply won't provide.
No need to ask your friends 
For well-intentioned Good Advice 
They're happy to oblige.
(And though I know you want to)
No need to promise we will work it out
And start again
Let's simply turn the page.

It's a goodbye song
A little bitter, but it's sweet
And you always wanted one
It comes a little late, but it's complete
It's from the heart
Please remember: I love you dearly
Although we have to part.

So I won't cling to you
Because it's driving you away
No need for subterfuge
I've all run out of insights
And inspiring things to say.
No need to worry so about me
'Cause you know
I'm landing on my feet 

A little late, but I'm complete.
I speak from the heart:
Please remember, I love you dearly
Although we have to part.
Please remember, I love you dearly

I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.

Well I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray
You know the preacher liked the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay

'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her
So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
And she danced without a net upon the wire

Baby is an awful lot like me

We don't cry out loud, we keep it inside
Learn how to hide your feelings, fly high and proud
And if you should fall remember you almost had it all

Baby saw the day they pulled the big top down
They left be-hind her dreams among the litter
And the different kind of love she thought she'd found 
Was nothing more than sawdust and some glitter
But baby can't be broken 'cause you see
She had the finest teacher, that's me

First wound of pride and how you cried and cried

"I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Lost my heart in its recipe
Made me see what I want to see
Be what I want to be

But I think more than I ought to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine, is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love

Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me, nearly here?

Lilac wine, is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that he, or am I going crazy, dear?

Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready for my love",6

I see a face we used to know
I pass a place we used to go
When you were mine

I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
Sunshine after the rain
Oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end

I start to cry, each day's the same since your goodbye

I realize maybe I was wrong to leave
Better swallow up my silly country pride
 
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I started from
Callin' home, runnin' home
Down the Gasoline Alley where I was born
 
Where the weather's better and the rails unfreeze
And the wind don't whistle 'round your knees
I'll put on my weather suit and catch him in the rain
I'll be home before the milk's upon the door

Should I stray to the house on the hill
Let it be known that my intentions were good
I'd be singing in the alley if I could 
 
And if I go away and it's my turn to go
Should the blood run cold in my veins
Just one favor I'd be askin' you
Don't bury me here, it's too cold

To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember",5

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man

They say that it's a man's world
Well you can improve that by me
And as long as we're together baby
Show some respect for me

A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man
If you want a do-right-all-day woman
You've got to be a do-right-all-night man",5
"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",6
"I took my troubles down to Madame Rue
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine

I told her that I was a flop with chicks (*)
I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said ""What you need is Love Potion Number Nine""

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said ""I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink""
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like India ink (*)
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine
Love Potion Number Nine
Love Potion Number Nine
Love Potion Number Nine",6
"There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh ooh and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings, 
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it makes me wonder.
There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west, 
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees, 
And the voices of those who standing looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder, 
Ooh, it really makes me wonder.
And it's whispered that soon, If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, Don't be alarmed
Now, 
It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on.
And it makes me wonder.
Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know, 
The piper's calling you to join him, 
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, 
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How ev'rything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.
And she's buying a stairway to heaven.",5
"Out of the rain, under the shelter
I've been so long where the sun don't shine
Standing at the cross-roads, could have went either way
But now I've found you and the storm is behind

Out of the rain, out of the rain

Over the wall, I'm out in the open
Back on the right tracks, I'm feeling no pain
You took a sparrow and let it fly with the eagles
I can see a long ways I feel love again

Out of the rain, out of the rain

There was a time I was taking no prisoners
Standing with a cold hear, standing alone
It took your sweet love to pull me out of the canyon
I believe I can make it now, I feel like I belong

Out of the rain, out of the rain
Out of the rain, out of the rain
",6
"Ome say love it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed

Some say love it is a hunger
An endless, aching need
I say love it is a flower
And you, it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring, becomes the rose",6
"I remember other days, how I used to weep
Over things you said to me, I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises ev'ry single vow
All you did was laugh at me but things are diff'rent now

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Ev'ry road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me

How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live-long day just what next thing to do
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me
Ev'ry road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning

I cried for you
What a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer

I cried for you
Now it's your turn to cry over me",5
"What's your story, morning glory
What makes you look so blue
The way that you've been acting
I don't know what to do
For I love you, sure as one and one make two
What's your story, morning glory
Got a feeling there's a lot you're concealing
So, won't you let me know your point of view

What is your story, morning glory
You've got me worried too
The postman came this morning
And left a note for you
Did you read it, then you know that I love you
What's your story, morning glory
Give your answer to this patient romancer
Oh, won't you tell me that you love me too",6
"Why do you feel you'd be happy somewhere else?
Why do you feel you're missing out all the time?
Oh, if it hadn't been for your wife and children
You say you'd be off

Or is it just an excuse?
Or is it just an excuse not to stay here?

You're gonna leave, I don't believe it
You say you don't need me no more, I bet you're afraid to go
You say I tie you down, you've had enough of this town
Ad of fairweather friends

Or is that just an excuse?
Or is that just an excuse not to stay here?

You should reconsider
If the grass is greener, my dear
I left the door open
But you prefer to stay here, holding me near
You prefer to stay here, holding me near

Why do you feel I'm competing with you?
You know it's not fair because it isn't true
If you must find yourself not in material wealth
I think you've found it

Oh, but it's just an excuse
Yes, it's just an excuse
Yes, it's just an excuse not to stay here",5
"You and I will never be apart, apart
And you will never hear it from my heart, my heart
The distance kept alive, the only hope I have in time
Now you do what you do, I'll do what I do, I can't stop dreaming of you

[Chorus]
I want you to be here, I want it to be love
I want you to be here, I want it to be love
I want you to be here, here, here, here, here, here
I want it to be love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want you to be here, here, here, here, here, here
I want it to be love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I want it to be love

I remember the day that you walked away from me, from me
I hate to remember the day you walked away from me, from me
What you said to me the other day, was enough to make me feel okay
But I just want to reach in your heart, and I don't know how

[Chorus]

I want you to be here
I want it to be love
I want you to be here
I want it to be love

I want you to be here!

[Chorus]",7
"Dari stesen ke stesen naluri bertanya
Masih jauh lagikah destinasi di mimpi
Mengapakah terjadi sehingga tiada lagi
Yang sanggup hulurkan sekadar informasi

Dari hati ke hati kita terus meragu
Kemungkinan jawapan tersirat dalam diri
Yang kerap ditabalkan oleh para pujangga
Satu dalam sejuta buih dalam lautan
Manusia serumpun dari asal yang satu

Yang surut mengapa akhir ke akhir zaman
Istilah lawan perang masih wujud dan gagah
Apakah ini takdir atau rekaan kita

Kami anak zaman ini kini menyahut tugas
Untuk mengibarkan bendera damai
Moga anak kami tak lagi bermimpi",5

Cuando son la excusa de un comportamiento loco
Y barrer para un lado barrer para el otro

No cabs to be had out there

I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no

How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm

My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh, your lips are delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow
At least there will plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay

When the wind is blowing and it's cold outside?

Another after me

And yet when I receive your letter
I'm reassured by every line
I hope they still hold true
For me there's only you

Are you on the level?
Do you tell me lies?

And your deep blue haunting eyes
I love you so I hate to lose you

Say we'll never part

Never misses
Making a heaven for two

No indecision
I know that my vision
Is clear
When you are near
No need for sunlight
For you are the one light
I see
So real to me

That's what bliss is
Lighting whatever you do
Whole completeness
Blessed sweetness
Coming from someone like you",7

Then we spoke of the drought
And we chatted about his old uncle Ben

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel

They sigh for exotic lands

Yes, jaded roues and gay divorcees
Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain

Yes, lovers that bless the dark
On the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock

Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are

Night and day, day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go?
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

"You won't be satisfied until you break my heart
You're never satisfied until the teardrops start
I tried to shower you with lovin' kisses
But all i ever get from you is naggin' & braggin',
My poor heart is raggin'

The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if i did the same
You're only happy tearin' all my dreams apart
You won't be satisfied until you break my heart

The way you toss my heart around's a cryin' shame
I'll bet you wouldn't like it if i did the same
You're only happy tearin' all of my dreams apart
Unless you hurt me and you'd know that i'd cried
It doesn't seem as though you'll ever be satisfied",6
"Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first nighting

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Oh, autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down

Yes, jaded roues and gay divorcees
Who lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain

Yes, lovers that bless the dark
On the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again",6

Gee baby, ain't I good to you",8

By constantly refusing to dance with me

"Savoy, the home of sweet romance
Savoy, it wins you at a glance
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance
Your old form just like a clinging vine
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine

How my heart is singing
While the band is swinging
Never tired of romping
And stomping with you at the Savoy

What joy, a perfect holiday
Savoy, where we can glide and sway
Savoy, let me stomp away with you

Boo ba di ba di di bo bo bo

"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last, 
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now",6

Something dreamy for dancing 
While we're here romancing 
It's love's holiday

Close your eyes 
When you open them, dear

So

Close your eyes 
Rest your head on my shoulder and sleep 
Close your eyes

Close your eyes

And love will be our guide

"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
'Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life just catching colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an 'Airmail Special' too
Your answer was 'Goodbye'
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",5
"'Neath the stars, at bazaars
Often I've had to caress men
Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men
Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-men

Darling, can't you see?
'Twas for charity?
Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious
Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?

I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now
How long has this been goin' on?

There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen sweet, I repeat
How long has this been goin' on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
I know how columbus felt
Finding another world

Kiss me once, then once more
What a dunce I was before
What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been goin' on?

Kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it four

What a break, for heaven's sake
How long has this been goin' on?",5

Waiting for you to come around and hold me tight
I've been wanting you right here by my side

Just get here in a rush
Every part of me aches for you
It keeps getting stronger; I hunger, I long for you touch

[Chorus]
Hurry home
I'm counting the minutes until you are in my arms
Hurry home as fast as you can, baby
I'll be here ready to hold you; don't take it slow
Won't ya hurry home to me?

I miss the way you laugh off the blues
The way you're there to listen when I need you to
And, baby, how I'm needing you now

I know that you'll be coming soon
It's taking way too long
I asked the man up in the moon
To send you to me instantly back to where you belong

And when you come back, when you walk through that door",5

And nothing to say,
But simply go on my way
And call it a day.

I guess I'm ready to go
Right back on the shelf,
Because at last I've learned
Where you're concerned,
I've just been fooling myself.

I never had a chance,
I thought you cared for me,
But now I see I never had a chance.
I never had a chance.
Though you never told me so,
Somehow I know I never had a chance.

I knew we'd have to part,
For I could always reach your lips
But I could never reach your heart.
My dream about romance
Ended in a friendly chat.
But more than that,
I never had a chance.

"I took a trip on a train, and I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane, and I thought about you
Two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream
And every stop that we made, oh I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade, then I really felt blue
I peaked through the crack and looked at the track
The one goin' back to you, and what did I do?
I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars, a windin' stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

Waitin' night and day like a bump on a log
I'm goin' crazy; what can I do?
Help me find my way
'Cause I'm lost in a fog without you

The sky was fair above
But you took the light away
The day you took your love

Only fools like me could be tossed in a bog

And the dream we shared fell apart
Now I'm all alone in the night wind
Wind that brought the blues to my heart

Yesterday my arms were around you
And your lips revealed you were mine

Came to end the moment divine

Fresh with the morning dew
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane

You are perfection you're my idea 
Of angels singing the Ave Maria
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you 
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care
Ours is a love so rare
 
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air
Charming and debonaire
Those are the words for you
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare
That ""one in a million"" air
In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender
And in that love scene I gladly surrender
So rare, to have a future like yours to share
Sweetheart the way we care

You look at me and doubt

When stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming

When winds are tired of blowing
When grass is tired of growing
Then I'll be tired of you

Beyond the years till day is night
Till wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing

Will still be whispering, whispering

If my throbbing heart
Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you",5

That we played the game from the start
It's easy to lie to strangers
But what will I tell my heart?

When I smile to hide all the tears inside
What an ache it will be bring
Then I'll wander home to a telephone
That forgot how to ring, ring, ring

I'm telling you'll soon be back, dear
To fool the whole town may be smart
I'll tell them you'll soon be back, dear

We had to part
The moment you had touched my heart
And with you went my dream

All too soon
All too sweet
Was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there

What a shame that it's gone
All too soon
I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring

And as I reached the heights
The bottom fell from everything
You should know as well as I
Our love deserves another try

For we whispered goodbye
All too soon
Too soon",6

"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
British museum had lost it's charm

How long I wondered
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles hadn't past
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town
The sun was shining everywhere

Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said

"Drop me off in Harlem
Any place in Harlem
There's someone waiting there
Who makes it seem like Heaven up in Harlem

I don't want your Dixie
You can keep your Dixie
There's no one down in Dixie
Who can take me 'way from my hot Harlem

Harlem has those southern skies,
They're in my baby's smile, 
I idolize my baby's eyes
And classy up-town style

If Harlem moved to China,
I know of nothing finer,
Than to stow away on a 'plane some day
And have them drop me off in Harlem

"You left me a horse from Texas,
A house with installments due,
A letter with lots of x-s
Everything but you.

You left me some beans from Boston,
A bicycle built for two,
A memory to get lost in,
Everything but you.

Each day was so gay and so daring,
I loved every breathtaking minute,
For how could I know I was sharing
A kiss without a future in it.

You left me a dream to room with,
A coffee pot from Peru,
A knife and fork to spoon with,
Everything but you.

What am I gonna do if you turn me down
When I'm so crazy over you?

I'd be so lonely
Where am I gonna go if you turn me down
Why blacken all my skies of blue?

I tell you, I'm not asking any miracle
It can be done, it can be done
I know a clergyman who will grow lyrical
And make us one, and make us one

"The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is
The good book says go seek and ye shall find
Well, I have sought and my what a climb it is

My life is just like the weather
It changes wth the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers

And motion like the ocean
It's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man
Like I love him

Never treats me sweet and gentle
The way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental

Not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good
But whne the weekend's over
I end up like I started out

Just cryin' my lil' heart out
He don't love me
Like I love I'm
No, nobody could

I got it bad and that ain't good
So bad, so bad
I got it bad, so bad
Though folks with good intentions

Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad
I'm mad about you
Lord above me 

Make him love me
The way he should
Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
The things I tell my pillow

No woman should
I got it bad, and that ain't good",5

It was the sweetest melody
I know I lost heaven 'cause you were the song

Since you and I have drifted apart
Life doesn't mean a thing to me

Am I too late to make amends?
You know that we were meant to be more than just friends, just friends

I won't know sweet music until you return some day

Drifts a melody so strange and sweet

And my reverie
Brings you back to me
For, in my imagination
Love has lingered on
As though you'd never gone

Trying to pretend, this mood will never end

Lost in meditation
And my reverie
Brings you back to me",6

From my tender sentimental woes

With nothing fancy
Nothing much

A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

For the tenderness within your eyes

A new room for two room
Where every day's a holiday
Because you're married to me.

Not like a ballroom
A small room, a hall room
Where I can smoke my pipe away
With your wee head upon my knee.

We will thrive on, keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With mister and missus
On little blue chairs.

You sew your trousseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far from worldly cares
As our blue room far away upstairs!",5
"The world is lyrical
Because a miracle
Has brought my lover to me
Though he's some other place, his face I see

At night I creep in bed
And never sleep in bed
But look above in the air
And to my greatest joy, my boy is there

It his prince who walks
Into my dreams and talks

He dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night

I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
There's my love
Up above

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""
But I'm so grateful to discover
He's still there

I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love

I whisper, ""Go away, my lover
It's not fair""

He's still there

"The sleepless nights, the daily fights
The quick toboggan, when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses, and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates, the endless waits
The lovely loving, and the hateful hates
The conversation, with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain, no more strain
Now I'm sane, but I would rather be punched, drunk

The pulled out fur, of cat and cur
The fine mismating, of a him and her
I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh, the blackened eye
The words: ""I love you, 'til the day I day""
The self deception, that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals, it soon reveals
The faint aroma, of performing seals
The double-crossing, of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care, no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now), but I'd rather be punk drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle, of a him and her
I don't like quiet, and I wish I were
In love again, in love again, in love again",6
"Once I laughed when I heard you saying
That I'd be playing solitaire
Uneasy in my easy chair
It never entered my mind
And once you told me I was mistaken

That I'd awaken with the sun
And ordered orange juice for one
It never entered my mind
You had what I lack, myself

Now I even have to scratch my back myself
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind

Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again
To get into my hair again
It never entered my mind",6
"Johnny could only sing one note
And the note he sings was this
Ah!
Poor Johnny one-note
sang out with ""gusto""
And just overlorded the place
Poor Johnny one-note
yelled willy nilly
Until he was bleu in the face
For holding one note was his ace
Couldn't hear the brass
Couldn't hear the drum
He was in a class
By himself, by gum!

Poor Johnny one-note
Got in Aida
Indeed a great chance to be brave
He took his one note
Howled like the North Wind
Brought forth wind that made critics rave,
While Verdi turned round in his grave!

Couldn't hear the flute
Or the big trombone
Ev'ry one was mute
Johnny stood alone.
Cats and dogs stopped yapping
Lions in the zoo
All were jealous of Johnny's big trill
Thunder claps stopped clapping,
Traffic ceased its roar,
And they tell us Niag'ra stood still.
He stopped the train whistles,
Boat whistles,
steam whistles,
Cop whistles,
all whistles bowed to his skill
Sing Johnny One-Note,
Sing out with ""gusto"" and
Just overwhelm all the crowd
Ah!
So sing Johnny One-Note, out loud!!
Sing Johnny One-Note
Sing Johnny One-Note out loud!",5
"When you were very young
The world was younger than you
As merry as a carousel

The circus tent was thrilling
With every star in the sky
Above the rings you loved so well

Now the young world has grown old
Gone is the silver and gold

Sit there, and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl you're through
Just sit there, and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there, and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
That all you can count on are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use, old girl
You might as well surrender
Your hopes are getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender little boy
To cheer up little girl blue?",5
"Summer journeys to Niagara and to other places
Aggravate all our cares, we'll save our fares

We'll have Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island too
It's lovely going through the zoo
It's very fancy on old Delancy Street, you know
The subway charms us so, when balmy breezes blow to and fro

And tell me what street compares with Mott Street in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by
The great big city's a wondrous toy just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy

We'll go to Yonkers where true love conquers in the whiles
And starve together, dear, in Chiles
We'll go to Coney and eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll, where our first kiss we stole, soul to soul

And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show, they say
We both may see it close some day
The city's glamor can never spoil the dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan into an isle of joy",6

"I've been married, and married, and often I've sighed
""I'm never a bridesmaid, I'm always a bride""

I never divorced them, I hadn't the heart
Yet remember these sweet words, ""'till death do us part""

I married many men, a ton of them
Because I was untrue to none of them
Because I bumped off every one of them
To keep my love alive

Sir Paul was frail, he looked a wreck to me
At night he was a horse's neck to me
So I performed an appendectomy
To keep my love alive

Sir Thomas had insomnia, he couldn't sleep at night
I bought a little arsenic, he's sleeping now all right

Sir Philip played the harp, I cussed the thing
I crowned him with his harp to bust the thing
And now he plays where harps are just the thing
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive

(bridge)
I thought Sir George had possibilities
But his flirtations made me ill at ease
And when I'm ill at ease, I kill at ease
To keep my love alive

Sir Charles came from a sanatorium
And yelled for drinks in my emporium
I mixed one drink, he's in memorium
To keep my love alive

Sir Francis was a singing bird, a nightingale, that's why
I tossed him off my balcony, to see if he, could fly

Sir Atherton indulged in fratricide,
He killed his dad and that was patricide
One night I stabbed him by my mattress-side
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive
To keep my love alive",6
"It seems we stood and talked like this, before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes, you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happenin' again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when

When you're awake, the things you think
Come from the dream you dream
Thought has wings, and lots of things
Are seldom what they seem

All that you live to day
Things you do come back to you
As though they knew the way
Oh the tricks your mind can play",7
"Though I know that we meet every night
And we couldn't have change since the last time,
To my joy and delight,
It's a new kind of love at first sight.
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Every meeting's marvelous pastime.
You're increasingly sweet,
So whenever we happened to met
I greet you 

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand
It tells that you're standing near, and 

At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens his portals to me.
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for you.

Oh, the moon's not a moon for a night
And these stars will not twinkle and fade out,
And the words in my ears
Will resound for the rest of my years.
In the morning I find with delight
Not a note of our music is played out.
It will be just as sweet,
And an air that I'll live to repeat:
I greet you 

With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face.
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace.
When the music swells
I'm touching you hand

"Once I was young --
Yesterday, perhaps --
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps.

Once I was young,
But never was naive.
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve.

And now I know I was naive.
I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you.
Oh, what a lovely time it was,

How sublime it was too!
I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand.
Warm like the month of May it was,

And I'll say it was grand.
Grand to be alive, to be young,
To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,

Hear your voice say I'm all your own.
I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was

Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,
And I know what time it is now.
Grand to be alive, to be young,

To be mad, to be yours alone!
Grand to see your face, feel your touch,
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.
I didn't know what year it was

Life was no prize.
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes.
I'm wise,

And I know what time it is now.",6
"Wait till you see him
See how he looks
Wait till you hear him laugh.

Painters of paintings
Writers of books
Never could tell the half.

Wait till you feel
The warmth of his glance,
Pensive and sweet and wise.

All of it thrilling

"I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts Seemed romantic fools
A house in Iceland was my heart`s domain
I saw your eyes, now castles rise in Spain!

I took one look at you, that`s all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still,
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when
My heart stood still

Through all my school days, I hated boys
Those April Fool days brought me loveless joys
I read my Plato, Love, I thought a sin
But since your kiss, I`m reading Missus Glyn!",5
"My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky
My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of may, no twinkling stars
No hide away, no softly guitars

My romance doesn't need a castle rising in spain
Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true

My romance doesn't need a thing but you
My romance doesn't need a thing but you",6
"I work at the Palace ballroom, but gee that palace is cheap
When I get back to my chilly hall room, I'm much too tired to sleep
I'm one of those lady teachers, a beautiful hostess you know

One that the palace features, at exactly a dime a throw.
Ten cents a dance, that's what they pay me
Gosh how they weigh me down.

Ten cents a dance, pansies and rough guys, tough guys who tear my gown.
Seven to midnight I hear drums, loudly the saxophone blows,
Trumpets are tearing my ear-drums, customers crush my toes.
Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance

All that you need is a ticket,
Come on big boy, ten cents a dance.
Fighters and sailers and bow-legged tailors
Can pay for their tickets & rent me
Butchers and barbers and rats from the harbor
Are sweethearts my good luck has sent me
Thought I've a chorus of elderly bows
Stockings are porous with holes at the toes
I'm here till closing time
Dance and be merry it's only a dime
Sometimes I think, I've found my hero
But it's a queer romance

All that you need is a ticket.
Come on, come on big boy, ten cents a dance.",5

"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people i knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as i walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day i've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British museum, had lost its charm

How long i wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, i saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

For suddenly, i saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

"Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
My luck is changing, it's gotten from 
simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
I'll begin to reach my prime.

Now though I see what our end is,
All I can spend is just my time.

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of,baby.

Dream awhile, scheme awhile
We're sure to find

Happiness and I guess
All those things you've always pined for.

Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.

Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
I can't give you anything but love.

Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.

You have a lifetime before you.
I'll adore you, come what may.

"It's the wrong time, and the wrong place
Though your face is charming, it's the wrong face
It's not her face, but such a charming face
That it's all right with me

It's the wrong song, in the wrong style
Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile
It's not her smile, but such a lovely smile
That it's all right with me

You can't know how happy i am that we met
I'm strangely attracted to you
There's someone I'm trying so hard to forget
Don't you want to forget someone, too?

It's the wrong game, with the wrong chips
Though your lips are tempting, they're the wrong lips
They're not her lips, but they're such tempting lips
That, if some night, you are free
Then it's all right, yes, it's all right with me",5

To her boyfriend, ""fare thee well""
As columbus announced
When he knew he was bounced,
""it was swell, isabel, swell""

As abelard said to eloise,
""don't forget to drop a line to me, please""
As juliet cried, in her romeo's ear,
""romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

"I've wined and dined on Mulligan Stew, and never wished for Turkey
As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball, and what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad (Coward)
But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games, with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",4
"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",5
"Savoy, the home of sweet romance,
Savoy, it wins you with a glance,
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.

What joy, a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you
The home of sweet romance,
It wins you at a glance,
Gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Just like a clinging vine,
So soft and sweet as wine,
So soft and close to mine, divine.

"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",6
"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,

When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",6

A kiss made of gold,
Made of lover's gold

Now she walks alone and broken hearted,
For you've heard it told,
A fool and his gold
Are soon parted!

Saddest thing of all,
About the tale I've told,
Is that I'm the fool
Who wasted lover's gold!

And I show it
If you've got a heart
And if you're kind
Then don't keep us apart
Make up your mind
You're undecided now
So what are you gonna do?",7
"Come on and hear (2x), alexander's ragtime band,
Come on and hear (2x), it's the best band in the land!
They can play a bugle call like you never heard before,
So natural that you want to go to war--
That's just the bestest band what am, honey lamb!
Come on along (2x), let me take you by the hand
Up to the man (2x), who's the leader of the band,
And if you want to hear the swanee river played in ragtime
Come on and hear (2x), alexander's ragtime band!

"I'm so unhappy
What'll I do? 
I long for somebody who
Will sympathize with me
I'm growing so tired of living alone
I lie awake all night and cry
Nobody loves me
That's why

All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night

I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there
Playing solitaire

All by myself I get lonely
Watching the clock on the shelf

I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older
All by myself",4
"Get thee behind me, Satan
I want to resist
But the moon is low and I can't say ""no""
Get thee behind me

Get thee behind me, Satan
I mustn't be kissed
But the moon is low and I may let go
Get thee behind me

Someone I'm mad about
Is waiting in the night for me
Someone that I mustn't see
Satan, get thee behind me

He promised to wait
But I won't appear and he may come here
Satan, he's at my gate
Get thee behind me
Stay where you are
It's too late",3
"It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will make a fuss about you
But how about me?

It's over, all over
And soon somebody else will tell his friends about you
But how about me?

You'll find somebody new
But what am I to do?
I'll still remember you
When you have forgotten

And maybe, a baby
Will climb upon your knee and put its arms about you
But how about me?",6
"How can I tell you what is in my heart? 
How can I measure each and every part? 
How can I tell you how much I love you? 
How can I measure just how much I do? 

How much do I love you? 
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky? 

How many times a day do I think of you? 
How many roses are sprinkled with dew? 

How far would I travel
To be where you are? 
How far is the journey
From here to a star? 

And if I ever lost you
How much would I cry? 
How deep is the ocean? 
How high is the sky?",6
"Strange
How a dreary world can suddenly change
To a world as bright as the evening star
Queer
What a difference when your vision is clear
And you see things as they really are

I used to be color-blind
But I met you and now I find
There's green in the grass
There's gold in the moon
There's blue in the skies

That semi-circle that was always hanging about
Is not a storm cloud, it's a rainbow
And you brought the colors out

Believe me it's really true
Till I met you I never knew
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies

I never knew there were such lovely colors
And the big surprise
Is the red in your cheeks
The gold in your hair
The blue in your eyes",6
"Every time
I see a puppy upon a summer's day
A puppy dog at play
My heart is filled with envy
That's because
My heart is yearning to pass the time away
Like that pup
'cause I'm all fed up
And tho' it's wrong to be
I long to be

[Chorus:]
Lazy
I want to be lazy
I want to be out in the sun
With no work to be done

Under that awning
They call the sky
Stretching and yawning
And let the world go drifting by

I want to peep
Through the deep
Tangled wildwood
Counting sheep
'til I sleep
Like a child would

With a great big valise full
Of books to read where it's peaceful
While I'm
Killing time
Being lazy

Life is short
And getting shorter with each day that goes by
And how the time does fly
Before you know, it's over
That's why I'm
In such a hurry to pack my things and fly
To a spot
Where it's nice and hot
And hear the birdies sing
While I'm being",6
"As you listen to the band don't you get a bubble? 
As you listen to them play don't you get a glow? 
If you step out on the floor
You'll forget your trouble
If you go into your dance
You'll forget your woe
So

Come
Get together
Let the dance floor feel your leather
Step as lightly as a feather
Let yourself go

Come
Hit the timber
Loosen up and start to limber
Can't you hear that hot marimba? 
Let yourself go

Let yourself go
Relax
And let yourself go
Relax
You've got yourself tied up in a knot
The night is cold but the music's hot
So

Come
Cuddle closer
Don't you dare to answer ""no, sir""
Butcher, banker, clerk and grocer
Let yourself go",5
"There may be trouble ahead
But while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance
Let's face the music and dance

Before the fiddlers have fled
Before they ask us to pay the bill, and while we still have that chance
Let's face the music and dance

Soon, we'll be without the moon
Humming a different tune, and then

There may be teardrops to shed
So (but) while there's music and moonlight (moonlight and music) and love and romance
(let's face the music and dance, dance)
(let's face the music, let's here that music)
Let's face the music and dance",6

And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits
Puttin' on the Ritz

Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the Ritz

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper
Super-duper

Come, let's mix where rockefellers
Walk with sticks or umbrellas
In their mitts

"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems, and then there came a day
You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May
But soon the may time turned to December
You had forgotten, do you remember?",5
"Where the dreamy Volga flows
There's a lonely Russian rose
Gazing tenderly
Down upon her knee
Where a baby's brown eyes glisten
Listen

Every night you'll hear her croon
A Russian lullaby

Just a little plaintive tune
When baby starts to cry

Rock-a-bye my baby
Somewhere there may be

A land that's free for you and me
And a Russian lullaby",5

Tyin' up my white tie
Brushin' off my tails

I'm dudein' up my shirt front
Puttin' in the shirt studs
Polishin' my nails

I'm steppin' out, my dear
To breathe an atmosphere that simply reeks with class
And I trust that you'll excuse my dust when I step on the gas

For I'll be there
Puttin' down my top hat
Mussin' up my white tie
Dancin' in my tails

I just got an invitation through the mails
Your presence requested this evening, it's formal
A top hat, a white tie and tails
Nothing now could take the wind out of my sails
Because I'm invited to step out this evening
With top hat, white tie and tails",6

I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I could never make him happy
He'd be better off with you
I'm afraid I never loved him
All I ever wanted to do was

Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddled near
Give him babies one for ev'ry year, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me

You can have him
I don't want him
He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him
You can have him
He isn't my concern
And he can just return where he came from
I would look a trifle silly
Taking him away from you
That was never my intention
All I ever wanted to do was

Close the window while he soundly slept
Raid the icebox where the food is kept
Cook a breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee and some buttered toast
Wake him gently with a breakfast tray
After breakfast clear the things away
Bring the papers and when they've been read
Spend the balance of the day in bed, so you see
I don't want him, you can have him
You can have him, I don't want him
For he's not the man for me",6

You have danced with him since the music began.

Won't you change partners and dance with me? 

Ask him to sit this one out.
While you're alone,

I know where to find the boys
I don't go through a club or two
I just find you and there are the boys
To get you alone I strive
You ask me to tea at five

And wonder when my chance will arrive

How's chances, say, how are the chances
Of making you love me the way I love you

How many young men must I fight with
To be in right with
In right with you

How's chances for one of those glances
A glimpse of the heaven I'm longing to see

How's chances to end all your romances
And start taking your chances with me

My castle will need some restoring
Ceiling and flooring
Furniture, too",6

Everything in it's place as it should be

My cares upon the shelf

No strings and no connections
No ties to my affections
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy

No dates that can't be broken
No words that can't be spoken

Like a sailor that goes to sea
Like an unwritten melody
I'm free, that's me

Bring on the big attraction
My decks are cleared for action
I'm fancy free and free for anything fancy",6

History placed them in a romantic set
In between book covers they are side by side
But the real thing hasn't been written yet

Now it can be told
Told in all its glory
Now that we have met
The world may know the sentimental story

The greatest romance they ever knew
Is waiting to
Unfold

Now it can be told
As an inspiration
Every other tale
Of boy meets girl is just an imitation

The great love story
Has never been told before
But now
Now it can be told",7

So near and yet so far from me

Reaching for the moon and you.

And make faces when a member of the classes passes

Sniffing everything the way they do

Let us go to it, they do it
Why can't we do it too? 
Let's go slumming, nose thumbing, on park avenue

Let's go slumming, take me slumming
Let's go slumming on park avenue

Where the social hearts for Broadway lights are throbbing
And they spend their nights in smart cafes hobnobbing, snobbing

Come let's eye them, pass right by them
Looking down our noses as they do

Let us go to it, they do it
Why can't we do it too? 
Let's go slumming, crumb bumming, on park avenue",5

A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts? content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There ?neath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",7

I've tried so hard but I fear
You'll always follow me near and far

You keep coming back like a song
A song that keeps saying, remember

The sweet used-to-be
That was once you and me
Keeps coming back like an old melody

The perfume of roses in May
Returns to my room in December

From out of the past where forgotten things belong
You keep coming back like a song",5

The years when the day seems twice as long
Restless and sighing and laughing and crying

I'm certain we'll weather the warm and stormy day and impatient year
But we'll journey through the impatient years

When the jive becomes deluxe?
What's the number one request?

Seven-twenty in the books

Nobody there bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff, a-raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
And when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

He plays a boogie, he plays eight to the bar
A boogie-woogie, that is the way he likes to play on his piano
And we all know
That when he plays he puts them all in a trance
The cats all holler ""Hooray""
You'll hear them say, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

In a little honky-tonky village in Texas
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far
When he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler, ""Beat me up Daddy, beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

The people gather around when he gets up on the stand
Then when he plays, he gets a hand
The rhythm that he plays puts the cats in a trance
Nobody there ever bothers to dance
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""

A-plink plink, a-plank plank, a-plink plank, plink plank
A-plunkin' on the keys
A-riff riff, a-raff raff, a-riff raff, riff raff
A-riffin' out with ease
But when he plays with the bass and guitar
They holler out, ""Beat me Daddy, eight to the bar""",5
"If I am fancy free
And love to wander
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

There's something calling me
From way out yonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

I've got to give vent to my emotions
I'm only content havin' my way

There is no other life
Of which I'm fonder
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

No cares
No strings
My heart has wings

If I am fancy free
And I love to wander
It's just the Gypsy in my soul

I've got to give vent to my emotions
I'm only content havin' my way

There is no other life
Of which I'm fonder

"I'm out doin' the usual places
And I'm livin' it, like young
Then I dig me this face of all faces
He's the craziest, like young

He drinks coffee at Cafe Espresso
He reads Kerouac, like young
He goes where all the angry young men go
Recites poetry, like young

We start blowin' the pad around lovin'
And we're homin' it, like now
We spin records on cloud number seven
And he's reachin' me, like wow

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
If he were to brush me and go
I'm starting to wear my hair again
Like a square again

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion
I think, baby, it's like love

Now we're ridin' a rainbow to Cloudsville
And we're makin' it like young
Love soft as April snow
Love warm as candle glow
Love, love is easy to go

I'm all unstrung 'cause, man
He's got me feelin' like young
Without him I'm no good at all
Without him I'm less than a decimal
?

I keep gettin' the kookiest notion
I think maybe it's like love
I've been feelin' a crazy emotion

"Moonlight becomes you, it goes with your hair
You certainly know the right thing to wear
Moonlight becomes you, I'm thrilled at the sight
And I could get so romantic tonight
You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along
If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so

You're all dressed up to go dreaming
Now don't tell me I'm wrong
And what a night to go dreaming
Mind if I tag along
If I say I love you
I want you to know
It's not just because there's moonlight
Although, moonlight becomes you so",6
"You make me feel so young
You make me feel like spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I want to go and play hide-and-seek
I want to go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young",6
"I fetch his slippers, fill up the pipe he smokes
I cook the kippers, laugh at his oldest jokes
Yet here I anchor, I might have had a banker
Boy! what love has done to me
His nature's funny, quarrelsome half the time
And as for money, he hasn't got a dime
And here's the joker, I might have had a broker
Boy! what love has done to me
When a guy looks my way
Does he get emphatic, say he gets dramatic?
I just want to fly 'way
But if I left him I'd be all at sea
I'm just a slavey, life is a funny thing
He's got the gravy, I got a wedding ring
And still I love him, there's nobody above him
Boy! what love has done to me
His brains are minus,
Never a thought in sight

And yet his highness
Lectures me day and night;
Oh where was my sense
To sign that wedding license?
Boy! What love has done to me!
My life he's wrecking, bet you could find him now
Out somewhere necking somebody else's frau
You get to know life when married to a low life
Boy! what love has done to me
I can't hold my head up
The butcher, the baker, oh no he's a faker
Brother I am fed up
But if I left him he'd be up a tree
Where will it wind up, I don't know where I'm at
I make my mind up, I oughta leave him flat
But I have grown so, I love that dirty so-and-so
Boy! what love has done to me.",6
"Near Barcelona, the peasant crooned
The old traditional Spanish tunes
The Neapolitan street song sighs
You think of Italian skies

Each nation has a creative vein
Originating a native strain
With folk songs plaintive and others gay
In their own peculiar way

American folk songs, i feel
Have a much stronger appeal

The real American folksong is a rag
A mental jag
A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues

The critics called it a ""joke song"" but now
They've changed their tune, and they like it, somehow

For it's inoculated with a syncopated sort of meter, sweeter
Than a classic strain, boy you can't remain, still or quiet, for it's a riot

The real American folksong
Is like a fountain of youth
You taste, and it elates you, and then, invigorates you
The real American folksong, the masses coaxed on, is a rag

The real American folksong is a rag
A mental jag
A rhythmic tonic for the chronic blues

A lucky star's above, but not for me

Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss

"Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pit-a-pats through my brain
So darn persistent
The day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane

Comes in the morning without any warning
And hangs around me all day
I'll have to sneak up to it
Someday, and speak up to it
I hope it listens when I say

[Chorus]
Fascinating rhythm
You've got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm
I'm all a-quiver

When a mess you're making
The neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking
Just like a flivver

Each morning I get up with the sun
Start a-hopping
Never stopping
To find at night no work has been done

I know that
Once it didn't matter
But now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter
I'm so unhappy

Won't you take a day off?
Decide to run along
Somewhere far away off
And make it snappy

Oh, how I long to be the man I used to be
Fascinating rhythm
Oh, won't you stop picking on me?",5
"He loves and she loves
And they love
So why can't you love
And I love like too?
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love

We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong

And they love, so won't you

And he'll be big and strong
The man I love

I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so, all else above,
I'm waiting for the man I love",6
"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name

The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?

"The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from history I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But, oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune

They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how
But ho, ho, ho
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his Lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, ""Hello, goodbye""
But, oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together

For ho, ho, ho

Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha

Be off with your Irving Berlin

Go tell the band If they want a hand
The waltz must be Strauss`s

Lilting through the house
Then I want a melody

Swinging to three-quarter time

"Once I visited my cousin, in Milwaukee, USA
She got boyfriends by the dozen, when she sang in a lowdown way
She was a positive sensation
The songs that she sang would never miss
My cousin was my inspiration
That`s how I got like this

I got a cousin in Milwaukee
She`s got a voice so squawky
And though she`s tall and kind of gawky
Oh, how she gets the men

Her singing isn`t operatic
It`s got a lot of static
What makes your heart get acrobatic
Nine times out of ten

When she sings hot, you can`t be solemn
It sends the shivers up and down your spinal column
When she sings blue, the men shout, ""What stuff!""
That baby is hot stuff

So if you like the way I sing songs,
If you think that I`m a wow
You can thank my squawky cousin from Milwaukee
Because she taught me how

Home through every storm, never failing,
The day you're mine this world will be in tune,

The first time I met you
I hit the ceiling
I could not forget you

You were completely sweet
Oh, what could I do?
I wanted phrases
to sing his praises

That certain feeling
The one that they all know
No use concealing
I`ve got what they call love

Now we`re together
Let`s find out whether
You`re feeling, that feeling too

I felt it happen
Just as you came in view
Grew sort of dizzy
Thought gee, who is he?

That certain feeling
I`m here to confess it
Is so appealing

I can not hide it
I must confide it

Become the happiest girl alive

Bitter was my cup
But no more will I be the mourner
For I've certainly turned the corner
Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me

Every one beams

Love`s in session
And my depression
Is unmistakably through

Who cares what the public chatters
Love's the only thing that matters

Who cares if the sky cares to fall in the sea
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!

Who cares how history rates me
As long as your kiss intoxicates me?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you

"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake

Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms

Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best

Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more

Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there

Romance, finis, your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more",5

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

Will find it hard to sleep tonight

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the Snowman

Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic

In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the Snowman

Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the Snowman

Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village

With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the Snowman

Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day
Thumpety thump thump

Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump

Making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight.

Cho: Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh, O
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way,
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh.

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot,
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot.

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away.

Now the ground is white,
Go it while you're young,
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song.
Just bet a bob-tailed bay,
Two-forty as his speed,
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead.",6
"Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate to go out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow",5
"You better watch out you better not cry
You better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list he's checking it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Oh, you better watch out you better not cry
You better not pout I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town",7
"Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, ""Yoo-hoo!""
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand

We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

"I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
""May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

"Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
In his place is the new bird
He's singing our song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?""
We'll say ""No man, but you can do the job when you're in town""
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr.Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though you know, kids are chillin'
We'll frolick and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland (wo oh oh ...)",6
"Let's get away from sleigh bells
Let's get away from snow 
Let's make a break some Christmas, dear
I know the place to go

How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea? 
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree? 

How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do? 
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island 
You will never stray for everyday 
Your Christmas dreams come true

"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys
And goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said
Many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you! 

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase

"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart

"Back in the days of knights in armor
There once lived a lovely charmer
Swimming in the Rhine
Her figure was divine

She had a yen for all the sailors
Fishermen and gobs and whalers
She had a most immoral eye
They called her Lorelei

She created quite a stir
And I want to be like her

I want to be like that gal on the river
Who sang her song to the ships passing by
She had the goods and how she could deliver
The Lorelei

She used to love in a strange kind of fashion
With lots of hey-ho-de-ho-hi-de-hi
And I can guarantee I`m full of passion
Like the Lorelei

I`m treacherous, yeah-yeah
Oh, I just can`t hold myself in check
I`m lecherous, yeah-yeah
I want to bite my initials on a sailor`s neck

Each affair has a kick and a wallop
For what they crave, I can always supply
I want to be just like that other trollop
The Lorelei

I want to be just like that other trollop
The Lorelei",6

Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe

Ya know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, babe
So there's never, never a trace of red

Now on the sidewalk, huh, huh, whoo sunny morning, un huh
Lies a body just oozin' life, eek
And someone's sneakin' 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat, huh, huh, down by the river don'tcha know
Where a cement bag's just a'drooppin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten old Macky's back in town
Now d'ja hear 'bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash

Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown

"That old black magic has me in its spell
That old black magic that you weave so well
Icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witchcraft when your eyes meet mine

The same old tingle that I feel inside
When that elevator starts its ride
Down and down I go, 'round and 'round I go
Like a leaf that's caught in the tide

I should stay away, but what can I do?
I hear your name, and I'm aflame
Aflame with such a burning desire
That only your kiss can put out the fire

You are the lover that I've waited for
The mate that fate had me created for
And every time your lips meet mine
Baby, down and down I go
All around I go, in a spin
Loving the spin that I'm in
Under that old black magic called love",5
"As Dorothy Parker once said
To her boyfriend, ""fare thee well""
As Columbus announced
When he knew he was bounced,
""it was swell, Isabel, swell""

As Abelard said to Eloise,
""don't forget to drop a line to me, please""
As Juliet cried, in her romeo's ear,
""romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

"When the only sound in the empty street
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop, I open shop

When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town
That her smile becomes a smirk, I go to work

Love for sale, appetizing young love for sale
Love that's fresh and still unspoiled
Love that's only slightly soiled, love for sale

Who will buy? Who would like to sample my supply?
Who's prepared to pay the price for a trip to paradise?
Love for sale

Let the poets pipe of love in their childish way
I know every type of love better far than they
If you want the thrill of love, I've been through the mill of love
Old love, new love, every love but true love

"It's very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But, oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",6
"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me",5
"I hadn't anyone till you, I was a lonely one till you
I used to lie awake and wonder, if there could be
A someone in this wide world, just made for me
And now I see I had to save my love for you

I never gave my love till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you
And through my lonely heart demanding it, 
Cupid took a hand in it
I hadn't anyone till you",6
"Come to me, my melancholy baby
Cuddle up and don't be blue
All your fears are foolish fancy, maybe
You know, dear, that I'm in love with you

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

Every cloud must have a silver lining
Wait until the sun shines through

Please, cuddle up, my dear
While, I kiss away each tear
Or else, I shall be melancholy too

"Reach for tomorrow
Today belongs to the past
The golden hopes of your yesterdays
Can all be yours at last

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your head in the sky
You may get hurt
In a thousand ways
But give it one more try

Have no regret about
Forget about
The chances you missed
In days to come
I know there's something
Better than this

Reach for tomorrow
And keep your dreams ever new
No matter how many times it seems
That dreams are not for you

Reach for tomorrow
And make them all come true",6
"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",5
"If you've never had to count a million sheep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue
If you've never had to cry yourself to sleep
Then you've never been blue, never been blue

I know I could go on laughing and troubled
Plain trouble
But when it concerns the heart
The pain seems doubled

Never worry about a little hurt or two
There's nothing at all bothering you
If you've never had a pal who stole your gal
Then you've never known you've never been blue

Something that this life will mind is plain, honey
That's funny
When you're miles away from home
It's not so sunny

No one ever knows what I go through
While someone at home is babying you
If you've never had to miss a goodnight kiss
Then you've never known you've never been blue",5
"Who's Sorry Now?
Who's Sorry Now?
Who's heart is aching for breaking each vow?
Who's sad and blue?
Who's crying too? 
Just like I cried over you.
Right to the end, 
Just like a friend,
I tried to warn you somehow.
You had your way,
Now you must pay;

"It begins to tell 'round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well till after sundown
Supper time I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad 'round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it too

When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending?
Darlin', I need you; lately I find
You're out of my heart and I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings 'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing for your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around

Feelin' sad really gets bad
'Round, 'round, 'round midnight",5
"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The mystery of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The memory of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",7
"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife?
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small is all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A home that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the grief and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but, yes, indeedy
Give me the simple life",5
"I heard it came to town
A new kind of rhythm
Spread around
Sort of set you sizzlin'

Plenty tight
Swingin' down the fifties
Now they're all through with symphony
Ho ho ho, rock it for me

The opera was the thing

So won't you satisfy my soul
With the rock and roll?

You can't be tame
While the band is playin'
It ain't no shame
To keep your body swayin'
Beat it out in the minor key
Ho ho ho, rock it for me

While the band is swingin'
Oh, Chick Webb's sockin'
And the band is rockin'
So send me lightly, politely
Brightly, and slightly
Ho ho ho, rock it for me

Now I'm all through with this stuff they call symphony
Come on, boys, and sorta rock it for me

It's true that once upon a time
The opera was the thing
But today the rage is rhythm and rhyme

To keep your body swayin'
Beat it out in the minor key

But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue.

When you left the curtain fell

Now my world's a faded pastel

I've known the thrill of loving you.
And that alone is more than I was created for

Thought we said goodbye last night

I turned and tossed until it seems you have gone
But here you are with the dawn
Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you
Good morning heartache what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't shake you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight to Sunday blues

Good morning heartache
Here we go again
Good morning heartache
You're the one
Who knows me well
Might as well get use to you hanging around
Good morning heartache
Sit down",7
"I got a guy
He don't dress me in sable
He looks nothing like Gable
But he's mine
And I think he's too divine

I got a guy
When he starts into pet me
He's the sauce on spaghetti
He's the kind
That you can't keep off your mind

I got a guy
And he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough
But when I polish him up, I swear
He'll be a Tiffany solitaire

I'm riding high
'Cause I'm happy and carefree
There is nothing that can scare me
'Cause I got a guy

I got a guy
And he's tough
He's just a gem in the rough
But when I polish him up, I swear
He'll be a Tiffany solitaire

I'm riding high
'Cause I'm happy and carefree

'Cause I got a guy",6
"They call it that jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts
Wherever they play, the funny rhythm they play

It started on journal square
And somebody heard it there
He put it right on the air
And now you hear it everywhere

Uptown, gave it new licks
Downtown, added some tricks
No town, makes it sound, the same
As where it came from

So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some jersey spot
And whether you're hep or not
The jersey bounce'll make you swing

How I love that jersey bounce
(scat)
Oh come on and play that jersey bounce

They call it that jersey bounce
A rhythm that really counts
The temperature always mounts
Whenever they play that jersey bounce

It started on journal square
And somebody heard it there
He put it right on the air
That tune called the jersey bounce

Downtown, added some tricks
No town, make it sound the same
As where it came from

So if you don't feel so hot
Go out to some jersey spot

Ounce by ounce

Puts you right in the swing

It'll make you swing

Give me that jersey bounce",6
"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie

"The moon is the same moon above you
Aglow with it's cool evening light
But shining at night, in Tunisia
Never does it shine so bright

The stars are aglow in the heavens
But only the wise understand
That shining at night in Tunisia
They guide you through the desert sand

Words fail, to tell a tale
Too exotic to be told
Each night's a deeper night
In a world, ages old

The cares of the day seem to vanish
The ending of day brings release
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
Where the nights are filled with peace

Each wonderful night in Tunisia",7
"When days are long and nights are lonely
And all my daydreams have gone astray
I think about the one and only
Who's bound to find me some golden day

The one I love is coming along some day
And I'll have none except the one I love
He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

And though our meeting is left to chance
Until our meeting 
I still will have my dream romance
And through the night I pray to the moon above
To please be kind and find the one I love",6
"Signing off
Does it surprise you
I won't need your lips anymore
Signing off

Can't idolize you
My heart crossed your name off the door
Signing off
Now that I've told you
That this is just where I came in

Signing off
Why should I hold you
You've already said I can't win
It's strange how the rest of the world knows

The things you should see at a glance
And I want what all of the world knows
A person to person romance

Signing off
I can't pretend dear
My trip to the stars took a spill
We're all through

This is the ending
Because you only wanted a thrill
I'm signing off
I'll always remember the pleasure

Of friendship and all that it's worth
I know that it's something to treasure
From here to the ends of the earth

Signing off
Happy I met you
So please make me happy again
And be sure I won't forget you
The best of everything until then

I'm signing off
Signing Off",8
"The song a robin sings,
Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.
That ripples through a nook where two lovers hide.

That great symphonic theme,
That's Stella by starlight,
And not a dream,
My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

"You're walkin' along the street, or you're at a party,
Or else you're alone and then you suddenly dig,
You're looking' in someone's eyes, you suddenly realize
That this could be the start of something big.

You're lunching at twenty-one and watchin' your diet,
Declining a Charlotte russe, accepting a fig,
When out of a clear blue sky, it's suddenly gal and guy,
And this could be the start of something big.

There's no controlling the unrolling of your fate, my friend,
Who knows what's written in the magic book.
But when a lover you discover at the gate my friend,
Invite her in without a second look.

You're up in an aeroplane or dining at sardi's,
Or lying at Malibu alone on the sand,
You suddenly hear a bell, and right away you can tell
That this could be the start of something grand.

This could be the start of something very big,
Why don't you play your part?
Please give your heart to me, and see.
This could be the start of something wonderful,
Why don't you take a chance?
Just try romance with me, and see.

Your watchin' the sun come up and countin' your money,
Or else in a dim cafe you're ordering wine,
Then suddenly there he is, and you wanna be where he is,
And this must be the start of something,
This could be the heart of something,
This could be the start of something big.",6
"This year's crop of kisses
Don't seem as sweet to me
This year's crop just misses
What kisses used to be
This year's new romance
Doesn't seem to have a chance
Even helped by Mr. Moon above
This year's crop of kisses is not for me
For I'm still wearin' last year's love",6
"Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world, we're not too proud
To cling together; we're strong
As long as we're together

Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless night were not in vain
For we're together, and what is there
To fear together?

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together",7
"There`s a cheerful little earful
Gosh I miss it something fearful
And this cheerful little earful
Is the well known ""I love you.""

Stocks can go down, business slow down
But the milk and honey flow down
With a cheerful little earful
Of the well known ""I love you.""

In ev`ry play it`s a set phrase
What the public get phrase
But as a pet phrase it`ll do do do
Poo-pa-roo-it
Soft and see you-it
Make me happy, you can do it.

With a cheerful little earful
Of the well known ""I love you.""",5
"The gentleman is a dope, a man of many faults
A clumsy Joe who wouldn't know a Rhumba from a Waltz
The gentleman is a dope and not my cup of tea
(Why do I get in a dither? He doesn't belong to me)

The gentleman isn't bright; he doesn't know the score
A Cake will come; he'll take a crumb and never ask for more
The gentleman's eyes are blue, but little do they see
(Why am I beating my brains out? He doesn't belong to me)

He's somebody else's problem; she's welcome to the guy
She'll never understand him half as well as I
The gentleman is a dope; he isn't very smart
He's just a lug you like to hug and hold against your heart
The gentleman is a dope; doesn't know how happy he could be
Look at me crying my eyes out as if he belonged to me
As if; he'll never belong to me",6

The murmur of a morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair

Sure that's music, mighty fine music
The singing of a sparrow in the sky
The perking of the coffee right nearby

That's my favorite melody
You, my angel, phoning me

I hear music, mighty fine music
And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this song

Regrettin' instead of forgettin' with somebody else

I know he'll go with me until the end

And tell him that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear him on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around

He tells me ""baby, everything's all alright""

And free to do all those little things I might
I want you to know you wouldn't go

If I could be with you, I'd love you strong

Crying on the inside

No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
The tears are in my heart

Ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do

Crying on the inside

Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best

I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",6
"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams

"The very thought of you and I forget to do
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do
I'm living in a kind of daydream
I'm happy as a king
And foolish though it may seem
To me that's everything

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till Im near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
Its just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you
I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
Its just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love",5
"Before I met you no one attracted me
No love thoughts worried or distracted me
My disposition kept exempting me
Until you started in preempting me

And all this while, you've really been tempting me
Maybe you can tell me what we ought to do

Now that you've got me going, what you gonna do?
Is it up to me? Is it up to you?
What kind of game is this we've begun?
Was it done, just for fun?

We have necked, till I'm wrecked
Won't you tell me what you expect?
Is this to be a case of kiss and never tell?
Folly and farewell
Heaven or maybe hell

Which is it going to be, love or gin?
Wife or sin? Let's begin

"Turn off that charm
I'm through with love for awhile
I'm through and yet, you have a fabulous smile
So if I forget

Remind me
Not to find you so attractive
Remind me
That the world is full of men

When I start to miss you
To touch your hand
To kiss you
Remind me
To count to ten

I had a feeling when I met you
You'd drive me crazy if I let you
But all my efforts to forget you
Remind me I'm in love again

I get my heart, well in hand, and I'm certain
That I can take you, or leave you alone
Then you begin that beguine again
And boom, I give in , again
I have a will made of steel, my friend
But when it seems about to bend

Remind me
Not to mention that I love you
Remind me
To be sorry that we met

Although I adore you
Remind me to ignore you
You're one thing I will regret

So when your charm begins to blind me
I'll simply tie my hands behind me
Don't let me kiss you please, remind me
Unless, my darling, you forget",6

I leave it to you
She did just what you'd do too

She didn't say yes
She didn't say no
They very soon stood beside his chateau
They lingered like two poor waifs outside
For well she knew `twas only safe outside

She murmured, ""I'm not afraid of ice,
I only wish that I was made of ice""

She did just what you'd do too

She didn't say yes
She didn't say no

She wanted it so

Above her sweet love was beckoning
And yet she knew there'd be a reckoning

She wanted to climb
But dreaded to fall
So bided her time
And clung to the wall

She wanted to act ad libitum
But feared to lose her equilibrium

So what did she do?

She did just what you'd do too",6

When the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you

And the way you look tonight.
Yes you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
And the way you look tonight.
With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my fear apart

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
It touches my foolish heart.
Lovely 
Never, ever change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it ?
'Cause I love you 

Just the way you look tonight.
Mm, Mm, Mm, Mm,
Just the way you look to-night.",6

I love the rocks and what is more
With you there, they'd never be a bore

Life is such a breezy game
Love all kinds of weather 'long as we're together
I love to hear you say my name

I love good wine and fine cuisine
And candle light; I like the scene
But, baby, if you know what I mean
I love being here with you
I love being here with you

I like a dance by Fred Astaire
And Brando's eyes, Yul Brynner's hair
But I think to tell you's only fair
That I love being here with you

And Cary Grant, oh do-dah-day
His utter charm takes me away
But don't get me wrong, how do you say
I love being here with you

Basie's band a-swinging, I like Ella's singing
Because there's something else, you know
They know how to say it, they know how to play it
They wind it up and let it go

I love the thrill of New York shows
I'd love to kiss Durante's nose
But I'd like to say before I close
That I love, and is love, I love being here with you",7

It`s perdido
I lost it way down in Torito

High, was the sun when I held him close
Low, was the moon when we said, adios

Perdido
My heart ever since is Perdido
I know I must go to Torito
To find what I lost Perdido

High, was the sun when I held him close
Low, was the moon when we said, adios

Perdido
Goodnight perdido

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Too close, too close to know just when to say when
Be firm, be fair, be sure, beware
On your guard, take care, while there's such temptation

One thing leads to another, too late to run for cover
She's much too close for comfort now

Too close, too close for comfort; please, not again

Cover me with Heaven's blue

And touches with her hand the summer trees,

There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",6

You're a flower of love
Passion flower
Free as a star in flight
Laughing through the night

Your lips keep taunting me
Not wanting me
Yet haunting me
Each day

Stay with me
My passion flower
You are all I'm dreaming of
Passion flower of love
Passion flower of love",7
"[Chorus]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right

You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're going to give me everything
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

[Chorus]

So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

[Chorus]

You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right",6

"Heaven
I'm in Heaven
And my heart beats
So that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And the cares
That hung around me
Through the week
Seem to vanish
Like a gambler's
Lucky streak
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

Oh
I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me
Half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh
I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half
As much as dancing
Cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through to

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats
So that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find
That happiness I seek
When we're out together
Swinging cheek to cheek

Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through
Right up to

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats
So that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find
That happiness I seek
When we're out
Together dancing
Out together dancing
Out together dancing
Cheek to cheek",6
"There are many, many crazy things
That will keep me loving you
And with your permission
May I list a few?

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off key
The way you haunt my dreams
No, they can't take that away from me

We may never never meet again
On that bumpy road to love
But I'll always, always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife
The way we danced till three
The way you changed my life
No, they can't take that away from me",6
"Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine Lord abide with me

Hold thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death oh Lord abide with me

"Do not wait until some deed of greatness you may do
Do not wait to shed your light afar
To the many duties ever near you now be true
Brighten the corner where you are

Brighten the corner where you are
Brighten the corner where you are
Someone far from harbor you may guide across the bar
Brighten the corner where you are

Just above are clouded skies that you may help to clear
Let not narrow self your way debar
Though into one heart alone may fall your song of cheer
Brighten the corner where you are

Here for all your talent you may surely find a need
Here reflect the bright and Morning Star
Even from your humble hand the Bread of Life may feed
Brighten the corner where you are",6

Remember Christ our savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray

From God our heavenly father
The blessed angel came
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same

It is the night of the dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices

Fall on your knees; oh, hear the angel voices
O night divine, O night when Christ was born

O night divine
O night
O night divine
Night divine",6
"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",5
"Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey, Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey, Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Hey, Jude, don't let me down
You have found her; now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in; hey, Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you; hey, Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it
Better, better, better, better, better, better, oh

And suddenly your face appears

When it ends, it ends in tears

For everything that happens under the sun
But when it comes to being bad
A woman's not the only one

A man who loves me no more, no more

Nothing good to say about him
Still, I hate a day without him
Why should he have to be
The one, my only?

Trouble is a man
A man who's handsome and tall, so tall
Trouble is a man
Who's for himself and that's all

After all we've done, he didn't mean it
Now I understand--I should have seen it

Give that deep love to you and what magic you'll see

"With a million neon rainbows burning below me
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar
Here I sit, above the town
In my pet-palliated gown
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more
I'm deserted and depressed
In my regal-eagle nest
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor
When the only one you wanted wants another
What's the use of swank and cash in the bank galore?
Why, even the janitor's wife
Has a perfectly good love life
And here I am, facing tomorrow
Alone in my sorrow
Down in the depths
Of the ninetieth floor",6

Fighting vainly the old ennui

Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you?
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
But I get a kick out of you

I get a kick every time I see
You're standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high with some guy in the sky
Is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you

I felt a bump and heard an ""oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions, but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",5
"Autumn in New York
Why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York
It spells the thrill of first-nighting

Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds
In canyons of steel
They're making me feel, I'm home

It's autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York
The gleaming rooftops at sundown
Oh, autumn in New York
It lifts you up when you run down

Yes, jaded rou's and gay divorces
Whoo, lunch at the Ritz
Will tell you that it's divine

This autumn in New York
Transforms the slums into Mayfair
Oh, autumn in New York
You'll need no castles in Spain

Yes, lovers that bless the dark
On the benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York
That brings the promise of new love
Autumn in New York
Is often mingled with pain

Dreamers with empty hands
They sigh for exotic lands
Its autumn in New York
Its good to live it again",6
"There was a boy
A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""",7
"April showers, overhead offer me a chance
To protect her from the rain and cultivate romance
It's an opportunity, something to enjoy
Helter, skelter fly for shelter I'm a lucky boy
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters 
On the pane and we're alone
A chance to while away a dreamy afternoon
A lovely peaceful afternoon 
No one can see us
Rain It's so cozy in the rain
There's no reason to complain she'll wait for you
To hold her hand and then it's ten to one
You kiss her in the rain, rain, rain
 
Rain, let us cuddle while the rain pitter-patters

"I was dancing with my darling to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my loved one and while they were dancing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darling the night they were playing
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz

Ain't got no bounce in my shoes
Ain't go no fancy to tickle

I ain't got nothing but the blues
Ain't got no coffee that's perking
Ain't got no winnings to lose

Ain't got a dream that is working
I ain't got nothing but the blues
When trumpets flare up

I keep my hair up
I just can't make it come down
Believe me peppie
I can't get happy

Ain't got no rest in my slumbers
Ain't got no feelings to bruise
Ain't got no telephone numbers

And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears 

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always stay around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart 

You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you? 

You are the sunshine of my life, yeah

"Though with joy I should be reeling
That at last you came my way,
There's no further use concealing
That I'm feeling far from gay,
For the rare allure about you
Makes me all the plainer see
How inane, how vain, how empty life without you would be.

After you, who
Could supply my sky of blue?
After you, who
Could I love?
After you, why
Should I take the time to try,
For who else could qualify
After you, who?
Hold my hand and swear
You'll never cease to care,
For without you there what could I do?
I could search years
But who else could change my tears
Into laughter after you?",6
"When love comes in and take you for a spin
Oo la la la, c'est magnifique

But when, once more, she whispers, ""Je t'a dore""
C'est magnifique",7

Until the dawn what do I do?
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
Dream dancing with you

We dance between a sky serene
And fields of green sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time
Dream dancing with you

Dream dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through

Without love, I'm more machine
Without love, there's nothing doin'
I will die without love

Without love I am an island
All by myself in a heartbreak sea
Without love there's no denying
I am dying without love

Oh there is nowhere I can run
And there is no hiding place
Sticking out like a sore thumb
By the gloomy look upon my face

"We meet and the angels sing
The angels sing the sweetest song I've ever heard
You speak and the angels sing
Or am I reading music into every word?

Suddenly the setting is strange
I can see water and moonlight beaming
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore 
Then suddenly I see it all change
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming
Through it all your face that I adore

You smile and the angels sing
And though it's just a gentle murmur at the start
We kiss and the angels sing
And leave their music ringing in my heart",5

Just think that I'm the lucky one 
Who will lend her down the aisle
Each night I pray 
That nobody steals her heart away, 
Just can't wait until that happy day,
When I marry sweet Lorraine

Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn
Since this is the perfect spot to learn

Starting with the A-B-C of it
Getting right down to the X-Y-Z of it
Help me solve the mystery of it
Teach me tonight

The sky's a blackboard high above you
And if a shooting star goes by
I'll use that star to write, ""I love you""
A thousand times across the sky

One thing isn't very clear, my love
Teachers shouldn't stand so near, my love
Graduation's almost here, my love
You'd better teach me tonight

I've played loves scenes in a flick or two
And I've also met a chick or two
But I still can learn a trick or two
Hey, teach me tonight

I who thought I knew the score of it
Kind of think I should know much more of it
Off the wall, the bed, the floor of it
Hey, teach me tonight

The midnight hours come slowly creeping
When there's no one there but you
There must be more to life than sleeping
Single in a bed for two

What I need most is post graduate
What I feel is hard to articulate
If you want me to matriculate
You'd better teach me tonight

What do you get for lessons?
Teach me, come on and teach me
Teach me tonight",6

"Some other spring
I'll try to love
Now I still cling
To faded blossoms
Fresh from worn
Left crushed and torn
Like the love affair I mourn

Some other spring
When twilight falls
Will the night bring
Another to me?

Not your kind
But let me find
It's not true that love is blind
Sunshine's around me 
But deep in my heart it's cold as ice
Love, once you've found me
But can that story unfold twice?

Some other spring
Will my heart awake?
Stirring to sing
Love's magic music
Then forget the old duet
Love in some other spring?
Spring?",6

Bonita, don't run away, Bonita.

Bonita, don't be afraid to fall in love with me,

Things that I see when you're with me, oh, my Dindi

And when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes - ah

(Ooh) But he watch her so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day, that she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at he

I must have seemed
When she told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold
I must have seemed
When she told me so sincerely
Why she must have asked
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence?
What was I to say?
What can you say when a love affair is over?

Now she's gone away
And I'm alone with the memory of her last look
Vague and drawn and sad
I see it still
All her heartbreak in that last look
Why she must have asked
Did I just stare in icy silence?
What was I to do?
What can one do when a love affair is over?",5
"Quiet nights of quiet stars, quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence that surrounds us.

Quiet thoughts and dreams, quiet walks by quiet streams,
And a window on the mountains and the sea - how lovely!

This is where I want to be, here, with you so close to me
Until the final flicker of life's ember.

I, who was lost and lonely, believing life was only
A bitter, tragic joke have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my love.",5

Far from your tranquil altitude
Sad is to know that no one ever can live on a dream

A heart that stops when you pass by
Only to cause me pain

I wonder who she can be;

Somebody loves me
I wonder who,
Maybe it's you.",8

I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

As soft as a will-o'-the-wisp and in its song

The lonely autumn trees, how softly they're sighing
'Cause summer is dying; they know that in my heart
There's no gladness because there's no you

How lonesome they seem in the fall

Our favorite nook in the wall

In spring we'll meet again; we'll kiss and recapture 
The summertime rapture we knew and from that day
Never more will I say, ""There's no you""

But social circles spin too fast for me
My ""hobohemia"" is the place to be

I get too hungry, for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother, with people I hate

Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of the girls

I'm broke, it's OK
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell, and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight, that isn't a fake
I love the rowing, on Central Park lake
I go to Opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that
I'm alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",4
"Laura is the face in the misty lights
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",6
"Behold the way our fine feathered friend,
His virtue doth parade
Thou knowest not, my dim-witted friend
The picture thou hast made
Thy vacant brow, and thy tousled hair
Conceal thy good intent
Thou noble upright truthful sincere,
And slightly dopey gent

You're my funny valentine,
Sweet comic valentine,
You make me smile with my heart.
Your looks are laughable, un-photographable,
Yet, you're my favorite work of art.

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?
But, don't change a hair for me.
Not if you care for me.
Stay little valentine, stay!
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak, are you smart?

"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame
There's no guarantee
That time won't erase his name

The fact is, the only work
That really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love, you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it

Holding hands at midnight
'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more

Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how

Just imagine someone
Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more

Loving one who loves you

"Listen to my tale of woe
It's terribly sad but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each evening I'm awfully blue
I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you, so

Oh, sweet and lovely
Lady be good
Oh lady be good to me
I am so awfully misunderstood
So lady be good, to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just
A lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me

Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just
A lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me

Oh, lady be good to me",6
"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",5

Yesterdays
Days I knew as happy sweet
Sequestered days
Olden days
Golden days

Days of mad romance and love
Then gay youth was mine
And truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth was mine

Sad am I
Glad am I
For today I'm dreaming of
Of yesterdays
Then gay youth was mine
The truth was mine

Of yesterdays",6
"I'm so unhappy
What'll I do?
I long for somebody who
Will sympathize with me
I'm growing so tired of living alone
I lie awake all night and cry
Nobody loves me
That's why

All by myself in the morning
All by myself in the night
I sit alone with a table and a chair
So unhappy there
Playing solitaire

All by myself I get lonely
Watching the clock on the shelf
I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder
I hate to grow older
All by myself",4
"I want a little girl to love a lot
I'd give her everything that I've got
For a little girl who'd fall in love with me

I want a little girl; she may not look
Like the kind in a picture book
But if she can cook, she'll suit me to a T

She don't have to wave her hair
Or dress in fancy clothes
And I wouldn't even care if she don't wear silken hose

I want a little girl to call my own
There must be someone that's all alone
Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me

Just a little girl who'd suit me to a T

She don't have to wave her hair
Or dress in fancy clothes
And I wouldn't even care if she don't wear silken hose

I need a little girl, that certain kind
The kind you read about but never find
Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me
Just a little girl who'd fall in love with me",6
"My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky when my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much if there's missing just one thing

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring
My own true love to me
If the ship I sing doesn't also bring my own true love to me",6
"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",6
"When the only sound in the empty street,
Is the heavy tread of the heavy feet
That belong to a lonesome cop
I open shop.

When the moon so long has been gazing down
On the wayward ways of this wayward town.
That her smile becomes a smirk,
I go to work.

Love for sale,
Appetizing young love for sale.
Love that`s fresh and still unspoiled,
Love that`s only slightly soiled,

Love for sale.
Who will buy?
Who would like to sample my supply?
Who`s prepared to pay the price,

For a trip to paradise?
Love for sale
Let the poets pipe of love
in their childish way,

I know every type of love
Better far than they.
If you want the thrill of love,
I`ve been through the mill of love;

Old love, new love
Every love but true love

Appetising young love for sale.
If you want to buy my wares.

"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

I am yours for the asking, darling
Any old time you need me
I'll be there with love that's lasting, darling
All through the years we'll stand together
Sharing the tears and stormy weather
And the sunshine will be yours and mine
Any old time you're blue
You'll have our love to chase away the blues

Treats me oh-so mean
My man he don't love me
Treats me awful mean
He's the lowest man
That I've ever seen

He wears high-trimmed pants
Stripes are really yellow

Stripes are really yellow

But when he starts in to love me
He's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble
Make you stay out all night long
Make you stay out all night long

Love will make you do things
That you know is wrong

But if you treat me right, baby
I'll stay home everyday
Just treat me right, baby
I'll stay home night and day

But you're so mean to me, baby
I know you're gonna drive me away

Love is just like the faucet
It turns off and on
Love is just like the faucet
It turns off and on

Sometimes when you think it's on, baby
It has turned off and gone",5
"You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad; oh, it's so sad
That I'm in love with you
Oh, you love me, then you snub me

"You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my
Brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew

And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that
You might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of
Yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature
Rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julies
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain
That this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to",5
"We're sitting out here on the runway
Waiting for the plane to leave
And the captain says, ""There'll be a short delay
Bear with me, please""

They gave us the usual hassle
""You can't take those guitars on board""
But the boys in the band just smiled
Heard it all before

And as they're starting to serve champagne
To the folks at the front of the plane
I can hear the engines roaring
We're on our way

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight

The movie reminds of my lady
As she waits, ""Where are those guys?""
Yes, it's nice to see old Butch and Sundance in the sky

And now the sun is beginning to rise
It's like looking down on Paradise
There's a ball of fire that's burning
Giving life

And we are flying home
I feel the freedom in my soul
Flying home at last
Flying home
I've got the freedom in my soul

And it's four in the morning
My world is calling
Speeding through the universe tonight",5

Oh, heaven is in your eyes
While the wind is sobbing
Underneath the stars
Both our hearts are throbbing
Like two guitars

Love here in the starlit hour
Night whispering lullabies
Let me dream forever
Underneath the silvery skies

Will it be just as sweet again
The glamor, the glory that we know?
Will I find when we meet again
The glamor, the glory?s still a glow?

But tonight, let us forget tomorrow
Here under the midnight blue
Love will bloom and flower
In the starlit hour with you",7

Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior

or two
A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling
Before you can count up
One, two, three. For

There's a small hotel
With a wishing well
I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people, who
wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel together
We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",6

Wouldst kiss me pretty? wouldst hold my hand?
Both thine eyes are cute too, what they do to me
Hear me holler, i choose a sweet Lollapaloosa in thee

Two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do
Give me just a plot of, not a lot of land
And thou swell, thou witty, thou grand",7

But I still have that rain, still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart

Suppose I didn't stay, ran away, wouldn't play
The devil, what a potion he would brew?
He'd follow me around, build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered I wouldn't know what to do

Might as well give up that fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song, I'm just gonna tag along

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish so often might perish

At break of dawn there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything

You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop

I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee
You turned the tables on me.",7

"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I`m with you once more, under the stars
And down by the shore, an orchestra`s playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
'Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don`t let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
'Till the stars that were there before return above you
'Till you whisper to me once more, darling, I love you

And we suddenly know What heaven we`re in
When they begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",5

I feel like a frightened colt
Just hit by a thunderbolt, I am in love

I knew the odds were against me before
I had no flair for flaming desire
But since the gods gave me you to adore
I may lose but I refuse to fight the fire

So come and enlighten my days and never depart
You only can brighten the blaze that burns in my heart
For I am wildly in love with you
And so in need of a stampede of love

Do you love me
As I love you?
Are you my life to be
My dream come true?
Or will this dream of mine
Fade out of sight?

On the rim of the hill
In the chill, still of the night

As Juliet cried, in her Romeo's ear
""Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear""

It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
It was too hot, not to cool down

So good-bye, dear, and amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

"Birds do it, bees do it
Even educated fleas do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

In Spain, the best upper sets do it
Lithuanians and Letts do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

The Dutch in old Amsterdam do it
Not to mention the Finns
Folks in Siam do it, think of Siamese twins

Some Argentines without means do it
People say in Boston even beans do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Romantic sponges, they say, do it
Oysters down in oyster bay do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Cold cape cod clams 'gainst their wish do it
Even lazy jellyfish do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love

Electric eels, I might add, do it
Though it shocks 'em I know
Why ask if shad do it?
Waiter, bring me shad roe

In shallow shoals English soles do it
Goldfish in the privacy of bowls do it
Let's do it, let's fall in love",6
"Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
Madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today
She is sorry to be delayed
But last evening down in Lover's Lane she strays
Madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

When she woke up and found that her dream of love was gone
Madam
She ran to the man who had led her so far astray
And from under her velvet gown
She drew a gun and shot her love down
Madam
Miss Otis regrets, she's unable to lunch today

When the mob came and got her and dragged her from the jail
Madam
They strung her upon the old willow across the way
And the moment before she died
She lifted up her lovely head and cried
Madam
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today",4

A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the arctic ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance",6

How long, how how long, baby how long?

Down in my heart, I have an aching pain.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking 'bout the good time that I once have had.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

I could see the green grass growing on the hill;
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

You're gonna be sorry, you'll feel so blue.
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you.
How long, how how long, baby how long?

Don't have no money for to ride the train.

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",6

It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Here`s to my first romance - ages ago
Here`s to the boys I've kissed, and to complete the list
Here`s to the boys who said ""No!""

Love, love, hooray for love
Who was ever too blase for love
Make this the night for love
If we have to fight, let`s fight for love

Some sigh and cry for love
Ah, but in Pa-ree they die for love
Some waste away for love
Just the same - hooray for love!

It`s the rocket to the moon, with a touch of ""Clare de Lune""
It gets you high, it gets you low, but once you get that glow...

Some trust to fate for love,
Others have to take off weight for love
Some go berserk for love
Loafers even go to work for love

Sad songs are sobbed for love
People have their noses bobbed for love
Some say we pay for love
Just the same - hooray for love!",6

Why go on stalling? I am falling; love is calling; why be shy?

Let's fall in love
Why shouldn't we fall in love?
Our hearts are made of it; let's take a chance
Why be afraid of it?
Let's close our eyes
And make our own paradise
Little we know of it; still, we can try

To make a go of it

To be or not to be--let our hearts discover

"I never traveled further north than old Van Courtland park
And never further south than the aquarium
I've seen the charm of Jersey City, but first let me remark
I saw it from the Empire State Solarium

And when those nickels pile up, we can toddle off in swank
And I don't mean an ordinary cook's tour
I mean a cabin deluxe tour

Someday we'll go places
New lands and new faces
The day we quit punching the clock
The future looks pleasant
But at present
Let's take a walk around the block

You're just the companion
I want at Grand Canyon
For throwing old blades down the rock
The money we have`ll go for travel
Meantime, let's walk around the block

Gangway, we'll begin
When our, ship comes in
I'll sit on your lap
All over the map

To London in may time
To Venice in play time
To Paris in time for a frock
To Boston in bean time
Darling, meantime
Let's take a walk around the block

In winter at Christmas
We'll visit the isthmus
And see how they lock up a lock
And then in Caracas, on a jackass
We'll take a ride around the block

We'll keep to our promise
To visit St. Thomas
And then at Jamaica we'll dock
The prospect is thrilling
Still I am willing
Just now to walk around the block

Onward, to Cathay
Then to Mandalay
Boom on to Bangkok
P'are'aps Vladivostok

We'll send the folks cables
Accumulate labels
Buy souvenirs till we're in hock
But since we are flat in old Manhattan
Let's take a walk around the block",5

You know it's spring my heart
So why not show it?

Pretend you're glad my heart
Although you're sad my heart

No two hearts ever beat quite the same

Go on and dance my heart
Our only chance my heart
Is to forget it

Should you despair my heart
He'll know we care my heart
And we'll regret it

If it's to be, we soon shall see
And if it's not to be,

Hoping you might fall into it

One kiss and then I knew it

He's the best professor in all the land""

Of the jazzy fiddle under his chin
Oh, what music
The clarineter could not be better

Hear that strain
I don't know just what it is, but it's great
They simply ruin it

"Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world
We're not too proud to cling together
We're strong as long as we're together

Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless nights were not in vain
For we're together
And what is there to fear together

Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we're alone together, together, together
If we're alone together",7
"I'll remember forever
When I was but three
Mama, who was clever
Remarking to me
If son when you're grown up
You want everything nice
I've got your future sewn up
If you take this advice

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Act the fool, play the calf
And you'll always have the last laugh

Wear the cap and the bells
And you'll rate with all the great swells
If you become a doctor, folks'll face you with dread
If you become a dentist, they'll be glad when you're dead
You'll get a bigger hand if you can stand on your head
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
Show 'em tricks, tell 'em jokes
And you'll only stop with top folks

Be a crack Jackanapes
And they'll imitate you like apes
Why be a great composer with your rent in arrears
Why be a major poet and you'll owe it for years
When crowds'll pay to giggle if you wiggle your ears
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Be a clown, be a clown
All the world loves a clown
If you just make 'em roar
Watch your Mounte bank account soar

Wear a painted mustache
And you're sure to make a big splash
A college education I should never propose
A bachelor's degree won't even keep you in clothes
But millions you will win if you can spin on your nose
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown

Give 'em quips, give 'em fun
And they'll happy to say you're A-1
If you become a farmer you've the weather to buck
If you become a gambler you'll be stuck with your luck
But Jack you'll never lack if you can quack like a duck
Be a clown, be a clown, be a clown",7
"""Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina""

Wishing is good time wasted,
Still it's a habit they say,
Wishing for sweet's I've tasted,
That's all I do all day.
Maybe there's nothing in wishing,
But, speaking of wishing I'll say,

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door
Whispering pretty stories
I long to hear once more
Strolling with my girlie
Where the dew is pearly early
In the morning.

Butterflies all flutter up
And kiss each little buttercup
At dawning.
If I had Aladdin's lamp
For only a day
I'd make a wish
And here's what I'd say

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

Dreaming was meant for night time
I live in dreams all the day, 
I know it's not the right time,
But still I dream away
What could be sweeter than dreaming,
Just dreaming and drift away. 

Nothing could be finer
Than to be in Carolina
In the morning.

No one could be sweeter
Than my sweetie when I meet her
In the morning.

When the morning glories
Twine around the door

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,

The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay,
Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,

Down with love, the root of all midnight blues
Down with things that give you that well-known pain
Take that mood and wrap it in cellophane

Down with love, let's liquidate all its friends
Moon and June and roses and rainbows ends
Down with songs that mourn about night and day
Down with love, just take it away, away
Take it away, take it away

Give it back to the birds and the bees and the V and E's

Down with signs, down with Cupid

Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",6
"Have you seen the well to do?
Up and down Park Avenue?
On that famous thoroughfare,
With their noses in the air?
High hats and arrowed collars,
Wide spats and fifteen  dollars.
Spending every dime,
For a wonderful time 

If you're blue and you don' know,
Where to go to, why don't you go,
Where fashion sits?
Putting On The Ritz.
Different types, who wear a day,
Co-pants with stripes, and cut away,
Coat, perfect fits?
Putting On The Ritz.

Dressed up like a million dollar trooper,
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Super-duper

Come, let's mix where Rockerfellas,
Walk with sticks, or umbrellas,
In their mitts.
Putting On The Ritz.
Spangled gowns upon a beauty of hand-me-downs, on clown and cutie,
All misfits.
Putting On The Ritz.

Tips his hat just like an English chappie,
To a lady with the wealthy happy.
Very Snappy 

You'll declare it's simply topping,
To be there, and hear them swapping,
Smart titbits.

"It only takes a tiny corner of 
This great big world to make a place you love
My home up on the hill
I find I love you still
I've been away but now I'm back to tell you

San Francisco 
Open your golden gate
You let no stranger wait outside your door
San Francisco
Here is your wandering one 
Saying I'll wander no more
Other places only make me love you best
Tell me you're the heart of all the golden west

San Francisco
Welcome me home again
I'm coming home
To go roaming no more

"Smile though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking 
When there are clouds, in the sky, you'll get by
If you smile, through your fear and sorrow
Smile, and there'll be tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through
If you'll....
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear, may be ever so near,
That's the time, you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile, 
If you'll just....

"A clown with his pants falling down
Or the dance that's a dream of romance
Or the scene where the villain is mean.
That's entertainment!
The lights on the lady in tights
Or he bride with the guy by her side
Or the ball where she gives it her all.
That's entertainment!
The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex
A gay divorcee who is after her ex
It could be Oedipus Rex
Where a chap kills his father and causes lots of bother.
The clerk who is thrown out of work
By the boss who is thrown for a loss
By the skirt who is doing him dirt
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!
It might be a fight like you see on the screen
A swain getting slain for the love of a queen
Some great Shakespearean scene
Where a ghost and a prince meet, and everyone ends in mincemeat.
The guy who was waving the flag
That began with the mystical hand
Hip hooray! The American way
The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!",6
"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",6
"Who cares if the sky cares
To fall in the sea?
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers,
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?

Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee,
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!",4
"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne.

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two.

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea
Casts a spell over me
Till I say to myself

Get ahold of yourself!
Can't you see that it never can be?
You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise

Like a summer with a thousand Julys.
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes.
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance

In this crazy romance,
You go to my head.",5
"I got the surprise, the surprise of my life
I had to stop and stare
I saw a man dancing with his own wife
And you will never guess where

Where, where, where, yeah, yeah that side
Chicago, Chicago
That toddlin' town, the toddlin' town
Chicago, Chicago
I'll show you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues 
In Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

On State Street, that great street
I just want to stay, I just want to stay
They do things they don't do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man who danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago

Chicago, Chica-are-are-are-are-ago
Free and easy town, brassy, breezy town
Chicago, Chica-are-are-go
Let me cool my heels ri-ight down at Marshall Field
Come and walk with me along the lake
To the drake Hollar and Hoot, all through the loop
Shout how-now to Mrs. O'Leary's cow
No she, she, life is peachy

Chicago, we'll meat at the pump room, Ambassador East
To say the least, on shish kabab
And breast of squad we will and get fleeced
Don't tell me sin is rampant and rife
Think of that man who danced with his wife

In Chicago, Chicago
I'm in this city
What a wonderful windy, time",7
"We're a couple of swells
We stop at the best hotels
But we prefer the country far away from the city smells

We're a couple of sports
The pride of the tennis courts
In June, July and August we look cute when we're dressed in shorts

The Vanderbilts have asked us up for tea
We don't know how to get there, no sirree
No sirree...
We would ride up the avenue
But we haven't got the price
We would skate up the avenue
But there isn't any ice
We would ride on a bicycle
But we haven't got a bike
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes we'll walk up the avenue
And to walk up the avenue's what we like

Wall Street bankers are we
With plenty of currency
We'd open up the safe but we forgot where we put the key

We're the favourite lads
Of girls in the picture ads
We'd like to tell who we kissed last night but we can't be cads

The Vanderbilts are waiting at the club
But how are we to get there, that's the rub
That's the rub
We would sail up the avenue
But we haven't got a yacht
We would ride up the avenue
But the horse we had was shot
We would go on a trolleycar
But we haven't got the fare
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes we'll walk up the avenue
And we'll walk up the avenue till we're there

We would swim up the avenue
But we haven't any lake
So we'll walk up the avenue
Yes we'll walk up the avenue
Yes a walk up the avenue's what we'll take!",7
"Words are flowing out like
Endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light, which
Dance before me like a million eyes,
They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a
Restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.

Jai Guru Deva. Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which
Shines around me like a million suns,
It calls me on and on across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Your little rollin' stone that rolled away
Strolled away
Mammy mine
Your rollin' stone is rollin' home today
There to stay
Just to see your smilin' face
Smile a welcome sign
When I'm in your fond embrace
Listen, Mammy mine...

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine
Right on that Mason Dixon Line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in ya
""Weep No More My Lady,"" sing that song again for me
And ""Old Black Joe"" just as though you had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'll deliver
The minute that you sing ""The Swanee River""
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye-baby with a Dixie melody

Any time
I hear a mammy sing her babe to sleep
Slumber deep
That's the time
The shadows 'round my heart begin to creep
And I weep
Wonder why I went away
What a fool I've been
Take me back to yesterday
In your arms again...

Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine

"Day in, day out
The same old hoodoo follows me about
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you
And, darling, I think of you
Day in and day out

Day out, day in
I needn't tell you how my days begin
When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine
Then I kiss your lips
And the pounding becomes
The ocean's roar
A thousand drums
Can't you see it's love
Can there be any doubt
When there it is
Day in, day out",6

I'll give it to you
If there's any life I have to live
I'll live it for you

What's my wealth
What's my everything

"Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more",5
"The party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It's time to wind up the masquerade
Just make your mind up
The piper must be paid

The party's over, the candles flicker and dim
You danced and dreamed through the night
It seemed to be right just being with him
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end
Take off your makeup, the party's over
It's all over, my friend

The party's over, it's time to call it a day
They've burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
Now you must wake up, all dreams must end

I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues

I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains
Sail the mighty ocean wide

To a little white cot by the sea
There's a little green gate
At whose trellis I wait
While two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me

There's a gray lock or two in the brown of the hair
There's some silver in mine too, I see
But in all the long years
When the clouds brought their tears
Those two eyes o' blue
Kept smilin' through at me

And if ever I'm left in this world all alone
I shall wait for my call patiently
For if Heaven be kind
I shall wait there to find
Those two eyes o' blue
Come smilin' through at me",5

For I'll always adore you, true as stars shine above
There is no breeze to cool the flame of love

Or the glamorous sky of blue
Maybe it was the mood I was in
Or maybe it was really you, really you

The world was fine as far as i could tell
And then quite suddenly i saw you, and i dreamed of gay amours
At dawn i wake up singing sentimental overtures

I taste the wine of real romancing now
Somehow this crazy world has taken on a wonderful design
As long as life endures, it's yours, this heart of mine",6

As anyone could be
Of course my life is not so merry
But that's alright with me

No love, no nothin',
Until my baby comes home,

As long as baby must roam,
I promised him I'd wait for him
Till even Hades froze,

He has loosed the fateful lightening of His terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah
His truth is marching on

He has sounded for the trumpet that shall never call retreat
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat

Our God is marching on

Glory, glory, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, Hallelujah

Funny, but here's that rainy day.
Here's that rainy day they told me about,
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way.

After it brought my lover near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day,
Funny, that rainy day is here.

"The loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gray
The glory that was Rome is of another day
I've been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
I'm going home to my city by the Bay

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill, it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air, I don't care

My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you, San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me",5

Makes the mighty ocean and the pleasant land
Little notes that sing, little words that rhyme

Little smiles of hope, little drops of tears
Make this thing [Incomprehensible], go dancing down the years

Little drops of rain, little rays of sun
Make the hope for rainbow, glow for everyone

Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock

Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue.",5

There's just a memory among my souvenirs

Some letters tied in blue, a photograph or two

Love can be insane
Love can be a life of sadness and pain

Love can be a summer shower
Love can be the sun
Love can be two hearts that flower as one

It can be, fine and free
But that kind
Is not so very easy to find

Love can be a dying ember
Love can be a flame
Love pledged in September
May be dead in December
You may not even remember it came

Love can be a joy forever
Or an empty name
Love is almost never ever the same

Love can be an evil-doer
Love can be a fog
Love can make you feel like you were a dog

Love can be a snow-capped mountain
Love can be the truth
Love can be an endless fountain of youth

It can be ecstasy
But it's true
It doesn't always happen to you

Love can be a four-score failure
Love can bring you fame
Love fresh as the morning
May be wild when it's 'borning
And then without any warning, it's tame

Oh love can be a sweet endeavor
Or a dirty shame
Love is almost never ever, the same!",7

You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, I heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies seem blue again
What else could I do again
But keep repeating through and through
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine, a rhapsody divine

Out of town were the people I knew

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day in London Town 
Had me low and had me down 
I viewed the morning with alarm 
The British Museum had lost its charm 
How long, I wondered, could this thing last? 
But the age of miracles hadn't passed, 
For, suddenly, I saw you there 
And through foggy London Town 
The sun was shining everywhere.",5
"There's just a few more hours.
That's all the time you've got.
A few more hours
Before they tie the knot.

There are drinks and girls all over London, and I've
gotta track 'em down in just a few more hours!
I'm getting married in the morning!
Ding dong! The bells are gonna chime.
Pull out the stopper!
Let's have a whopper!
But get me to the church on time!
I gotta be there in the mornin'
Spruced up and lookin' in me prime.
Girls, come and kiss me;
Show how you'll miss me.
But get me to the church on time!
If I am dancin'
Roll up the floor.
If I am whistlin'
Whewt me out the door!
For I'm gettin' married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Kick up an rumpus
But don't lost the compass;
And get me to the church,
Get me to the church,
For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!

I'm getting married in the morning
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.
Doolittle
Drug me or jail me,
Stamp me and mail me.

But get me to the church on time!
I gotta be there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin' in me prime.

Some bloke who's able
Lift up the table,

And get em to the church on time!

If I am flying
Then shoot me down.
If I am wooin',
Get her out of town!

For I'm getting married in the morning!
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime.

Feather and tar me;
Call out the Army;
But get me to the church.

Get me to the church

For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!

Starlight is reelin' home to bed now.
Mornin' is smearin' up the sky.
London is wakin'.
Daylight is breakin'.
Good luck, old chum,
Good health, goodbye.

I'm gettin' married in the mornin'
Ding dong! the bells are gonna chime
Hail and salute me
Then haul off and boot me
And get me to the church,
Get me to the church
For Gawd's sake, get me to the church on time!",6
"Did y'ever wake up in the morning
And grumble as you tumble out of bed?
You stub your toe, ouch!
You hit your elbow, ooh!
You bump your head, oh!
You step on a tack and you let out a howl,
There's soap in your eyes and you can't find the towel!
You try to comb your hair but can't arrange it,
Spill orange juice on your dress and have to change it!
Then all day long,
Everything you touch goes wrong!

Teacher told us, when this happens, never to whine or wail;
The same thing happens in life, but on a much larger scale!

It never rains but what it pours;
If lady luck should happen to desert you,
A bit of rain is never gonna hurt you,
So wait and the skies will all be blue.

It never rains but what it pours;
So what if all your troubles come in bunches,
Keep sticking to your silly little hunches,
And the sun will come shining through.

Bide your time and keep on hummin',
Don't you frown and sit around and weep.
Wait your turn, your day is comin',
And you'll be there on top of the heap!

It never rains but what it pours;
You may as well get all your worries over,
From then on you're gonna be in clover!
Smile when you should cry,
For every cloud there'll be a rainbow,
There'll be a sunbeam for every raindrop by and by!",5
"Swing Mister Charlie,
Oh swing Mister Charlie,
I don't care what tune,
Just make it a hot tune!
Play a note or two
Of a theme that's new;
And the notes you hit is harder than
Anything I've heard since time began!

Oh swing Mister Charlie,
Oh swing Mister Charlie,
No-one can swing it like you do!
I can't get enough
Of that swingable rhythm stuff
Swing Mister Charlie, swing!

Oh swing Mister Charlie,

"Wonderful pals are always hard to find
Some folks have one, some folks have none
And I was alone for years, but fate was kind
And in the end, sent me a friend
Although he's not much higher than my knee
Still he's the greatest thing on earth to me

Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbours a chase
But his smile is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys
He's always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're a vision to see

And when my work is done
Coming home from the setting sun
To the gate he will start to run
And then I'll kiss my boy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Little devil, that's what they say
But to me he's an angel of joy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Leads the neighbours a chase
But his smile, his little smile, is as cute as can be
Making noise, breaking toys, Ha-ha-ha
He's always fighting the boys
But his eyes, they're his Mother's
And they're a vision to me

And when my work is done
Coming home, coming home to the setting sun
From the gate he'll start to run
And then, Ohhh! I'll kiss my boy

Dirty hands, dirty face
Little devil, that's what they say
But to me he's an angel of joy",5
"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",6
"This is it, my great romance 
I want to hang on to this one big chance 
You're mine, my loneliness dies 
I feel fine, with stars in my eyes 
Oh, it fills me up to such a height 
To know this is so very real and right 
And I, thought love passed me by 
But I must admit this is it! 
Repeat last verse 
This is it, this is it, this is it...",6
"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",6
"Now gather round you sailor boys, and listen to my plea
And when you've heard my tale you'll pity me
For I was a real damned fool in the port of Liverpool
The first time that I came home from the sea

I was paid off at the Home, from a voyage to Sierra Leone
Two pounds ten and sixpence was my pay
When I drew the tin I grinned, but I very soon got skinned
By a girl by the name of Maggie May

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

I shan't forget the day when I first met Maggie May
She was cruising up and down on Canning Place
With a figure so divine, like a frigate of the line
So, being a sailor, I gave chase

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Next day I woke in bed, with a sore and aching head
No shoes, or shirt, or trousers could I find
I asked her where they were, and she answered, ""My dear sir,
They're down in Kelly's knock-shop, number nine""

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more

Oh, you thieving Maggie May, you robbed me of my pay
When I slept with you last night ashore
And the judge he guilty found her of robbing a homeward-bounder
And she'll never roam down Paradise Street no more

Oh, Maggie, Maggie May, they've taken you away
They've sent you to Van Diemen's cruel shore
For you robbed so many a sailor, and skinned so many a whaler
And you'll never shine in Paradise Street no more",5
"Love your skimmer Judy, where did you grab it?

My hat?
Oh Bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
Because there's a very interesting story 
Connected with this hat, there really is.
I was walking down the street the other day,
Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""
I went in, the saleslady put it on my head and I 
Thought it was a little matronly 

Time

Oh, now wait, no wait

Cut

When I got my arm around you and we're going for a walk
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, talk, talk, talk
When we're sitting close together in a cozy taxi cab
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, gab, gab, gab
Aristotle, mathematics, economics, antique chairs
The classics, the comics, darling, who cares?
There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

Cut
Sorry
When the parlour lights are lowered and the family isn't in
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, chin, chin, chin
When there's music softly playing and I'm sitting on your lap
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, yap, yap, yap
Forward passes, second baggers, or a jockey who is hot.
Or boxing, or hockey, darling, so what?

I'll attempt some other evening.
Well you can call for me at nine

Calling?
But if you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
What do you mean the same old line?
Same line

You asked me about my hat,
You've been standing there for an hour 
And a half talking your big fat head off

I thought
About golf

I just
You didn't even let me finish my story
I told you what I would do
Oh darling, let me finish
Steady, steady

Oh
It's so nice to close your lips with mine.",6
"You really shouldn't have done it
You hadn't any right
I really shouldn't have let you
Kiss me.
And although it was wrong
I never was strong.
So as long as you've begun it
And you know you shouldn't have done it.

Oh.
Do it again.
I may say no. no. no. no. no.
But do it again.
My lips just ache
To have you take the kiss
That's waiting for you
You know if you do
You won't regret it
Come and get it.

Oh.
No one is near
I may cry oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
But no one can hear.
Mamma may scold me
Coz' she told me
It was naughty but then

Please,
Do it again.
Yes do it again. And again and again and again and again and again
Turn out the light.
And hold me close
In your arms
All through the night.
I know tomorrow morning
You will say
Goodbye and Amen.

But until then
Please do it again.",6

Your lips, so warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine

How my heart is singin'
While the band is swingin'
Never tired of rompin'
Stompin' with you, at the Savoy

And I'm a-warning you
It's a victorious, happy and glorious new strain
I feel a song coming on
It's a melody full of the laughter
Of children out after the rain

Ringing through you
Love and glory, hallelujah
And now that my troubles are gone
Let those heavenly drums go on drumming

Ringing through you

He's got a smile that makes the lilacs want to grow
He's got a way that makes the angels heave a sigh
When they know little Joe's passing by

Sometimes the cabin's gloomy and the table's bare
But then he'll kiss me and it's Christmas everywhere
Trouble's fly away and life is easy go
Does he love me good? That's all I need to know

Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul
What is love but a cradle to sorrow

The wind blows memories through my hall
And I am all alone on New Year's eve 
The time I need you most of all

The gay ones don their silly paper hats 
And blow their stupid little horns
At midnight they will all be singing Auld Lang Syne 
But the sad ones sit alone before the fire and sip a glass of lonely wine

I wish you a Happy New Year darling 
May your new love be bright and fair
I hope he'll do those special things for you 
That I would do if I were there.

Before the old year lost it's shine
I'll keep that memory locked within my heart
That Happy New Year you were mine",6

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?",6
"What a lovely trip
I'm feeling so fresh and alive
And I'm so glad to arrive
It's all so grand
It's easy to see you don't need a palace
To feel like Alice in Wonderland

Back in Ohio where I come from
I've done a lot of dreaming and I've travelled some
But I never thought I'd see the day
When I ever took a ride on the Santa Fe
(want to take a ride on the Santa Fe)

I would lean across my windowsill
And hear the whistle echoing across the hill
Then I'd watch the lights till they fade away
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

What a thrill (what a great big wonderful thrill)
With the wheels singing ""westward ho""
Right from the day I heard them start
'Cross the Kansas plains from New Mexico
I guess I've got a little gypsy in my heart

When I'm old and grey and settled down
If I ever get a chance to sneak away from town
Then I'll spend my busman's holiday
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe

All aboard! (we came across the country lickety-split)
(rolling ninety miles an hour)
I can't believe I'm here at last 
Woo-oo-ooo!
(when you go travelling, it's best for you 
to take the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!)
I can't believe that anything could go so fast

Then you pull that throttle, whistle blows
Huffing and puffing and away she goes
All aboard for California, hey!
On the Atchison (on the Atchison)
On the Atchison, Topeka (on the Atchison, Topeka) (2x)
On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe!",6
"Love your skimmer Judy, where did you grab it?

My hat?
Oh Bing, how nice of you to ask me that.
Because there's a very interesting story 
Connected with this hat, there really is.
I was walking down the street the other day,
Ran into Mllicent Palmer, you know Millicent Palmer,
A very dear friend of mine.

How do I get involved?

Well we walked around the corner for what passes
For a millinery shop and she looked in the window and
Saw my hat and said, ""that is for you""
I went in, the saleslady put it on my head and I 
Thought it was a little matronly 

Time

Oh, now wait, no wait

Cut

When I got my arm around you and we're going for a walk
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, talk, talk, talk
When we're sitting close together in a cozy taxi cab
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, gab, gab, gab
Aristotle, mathematics, economics, antique chairs
The classics, the comics, darling, who cares?
There's a brand new moon this evening and the weather should be fine
If you  ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
I'll politely close your lips with mine

How's your golf Bing?

My golf? Ho-ho I'm really moving that ball out there, striking it a ton.
I had a sixty-nine Sunday, should have been a sixty-five.
Terrific wind blowing, couldn't drop a single putt, it was murder

Oh, I lost my head with this question

And of course the equipment, you just can't get any golf balls anymore
The actors are hoarding them all...and the caddies, huh they want an 
Annuity for eighteen holes. You've got to take an option on one to be sure
He'll show up.

Cut
Sorry
When the parlour lights are lowered and the family isn't in
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, chin, chin, chin
When there's music softly playing and I'm sitting on your lap
Must you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, yap, yap, yap
Forward passes, second baggers, or a jockey who is hot.
Or boxing, or hockey, darling, so what?

I'll attempt some other evening.
Well you can call for me at nine

Calling?
But if you ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, ya-ta-ta, same old line
What do you mean the same old line?
Same line

You asked me about my hat,
You've been standing there for an hour 
And a half talking your big fat head off

I thought
About golf

I just
You didn't even let me finish my story
I told you what I would do
Oh darling, let me finish
Steady, steady

Oh
It's so nice to close your lips with mine.",6

"There's a story told of a little Japanese
Sitting demurely 'neath the cherry blossom trees
Miss Butterfly's her name
A sweet little innocent child was she
Till a fine young American from the sea
To her garden came
They met beneath the cherry blossoms every day
And he taught her how to love the American way
To love with a soul 'twas easy to learn
Then he sailed away with a promise to return

Poor Butterfly 'neath the blossoms waiting
Poor Butterfly, for she loved him so
The moments pass into hours
The hours pass into years
And as she smiles through her tears
She murmurs low
The moon and I
Know that he'll be faithful
I'm sure he'll come to me by and by
But if he won't come back
Then I'll never sigh or cry
I just must die
Poor Butterfly",6
"Here he comes lookin' for his baby
It's for sure, sure and not for maybe
Don't ask when will the lucky day be
Here he comes and let him tell you himself:

If I seem to scintillate
It's because I've got a date
A date with a package of
The good things that come with love
You don't have to ask me
I won't waste your time
But if you should ask me
Why I feel sublime
I'm

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
It's for sure, not for maybe
That I'm all dressed up tonight

Steppin' out with my honey
Can't be bad to feel so good
Never felt quite so sunny
And I keep on knockin' wood

There'll be smooth sailin' 'cause I'm trimmin' my sails
With a bright shine on my shoes and on my nails
(alternate line: In my top hat and my white tie and my tails)

Steppin' out with my baby
Can't go wrong 'cause I'm in right
Ask me when will the day be
The big day may be tonight",6
"Suppertime, I should set the tables
'Cause it's suppertime, somehow I'm not able
'Cause that man o' mine ain't comin' home no more

Suppertime, kids'll soon be yellin' for their suppertime
How I keep from tellin' 'em?
That man o' mine ain't comin' home no more

How I keep explainin' when they ask me where he's gone
How I keep from cryin' when I bring their supper on
How can I remind them to pray at their humble board?
How can I be thankful when they start to thank the Lord?

Lord, suppertime, kids'll soon be yellin' for their suppertime
How I keep from tellin' 'em?

"Time after time, I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
So lucky to be the one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

You've kept my love so young, so new
And time after time, you'll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

You've kept my love so young, so new

"The night is bitter
The stars have lost their glitter
The winds grow colder
Suddenly you're older
And all because of the man that got away

No more his eager call
The writings on the wall
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray

The man that won you
Has run off and undone you
That great beginning
Has seen the final inning
Don't know what happened
It's all a crazy game

No more that all-time thrill
For you've been through the mill
And never a new love will
Be the same

Good riddance, goodbye
Every trick of his you're on to
But, fools will be fools
And where's he gone to?

The road gets rougher
It's lonelier and tougher
With hope you burn up
Tomorrow he will turn up
There's just no letup the live-long night and day

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman looking for
The man that got away
The man that got away",5

And ""Old Black Joe"" just as though you had me on your knee

Any time
I hear a mammy sing her babe to sleep
Slumber deep
That's the time
The shadows 'round my heart begin to creep
And I weep
Wonder why I went away
What a fool I've been
Take me back to yesterday
In your arms again...

B-B-B-Baby
Come on girls
You believe in love
'Cause I've got something to sing about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast you know they never last no, no
What you need is a big strong hand to
Lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart but
He needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better baby on your own

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees to express himself
You've got to make him express himself, hey hey

Don't go for second best baby
Put your love to the test you know, you know you've got to
Make him express how he feels and maybe
Then you'll know your love is real

Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not
Express yourself
Respect yourself, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby ready or not

There are others around much worse off than you!
If a load of troubles should arrive,
Laugh and say, ""It's great to be alive!"";

Hide the side that gets blue.
If you have nine sons in a row,
Baseball teams make money, you know!

Keep your funny side up, up,
Let your laughter come through, do!
Stand up on your legs,
Be like two fried eggs,
Keep your sunny side up!

Life can be a pleasure or a pain,
Good or bad, successful or in vain;
Happiness is just a point of view,
If you have it here's the thing to do;

Keep your sunny side up, up,
Drown a frown with a smile.
If you think it's raining for you,
Just remember, others are blue.

Start the day on the right side;
You'll find life worthwhile,
Learn to wear a smile,
Keep your sunny side up!",6

When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too

Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'

Won't look back,
When I say goodbye.
I'm gonna leave this a hole behind me,
Gonna take what's mine tonight.

In you I find forgiveness and sin's release

I want to keep on growing and show others too

Then was blessed and found I needed less
For you alone, dear Savior, have now shown
That you are not impressed with what I own
Thank you for giving me my brand new start
Lord, thank you for this feeling way down in  my heart

Thanks to you I can forget the sad years
You took away the heartaches and the tears
You saw me through, my Savior, you always knew

I would write when I was young
Back then I did it just for fun
Not knowing it was all a part of a plan
This precious gift you've given me
Can uplift many easily
And help them all
To see the light of love again

Some just don't understand my goal
Adversity may take it's toll
You gave me all the strength I need to see
That in the dark I'll always know
That burdens only make me grow
I've yet to see
The very best there is of me

So guide my heart
Direct my mind
Oh, Lord I pray
Each time I find
Words fall like rain
And ease the pain
So guide my heart

Have made me thankful, helped me see
That you will always be there by my side
Seems the heartaches have all gone
You gave me hope to carry on
Forever in your precious love I will abide

I had a dream that forever changed my life
I was redeemed through holy sacrifice
I close my eyes to shut out all His pain
Yet clear as glass I see it all again

I see the cross, the cross of Calvary
I see the one, who died for you and me
I see the blood on the path where He was led
A crown of thorns, held tightly on His head

My precious Lord relieved me of my sins
He sealed my fate for all eternity
My heart will be filled with joy again
Oh, precious Lord, when you return for me

As I awoke I saw a light so clear
Then Jesus spoke and took away my fear
I'll spread the word of His redeeming  grace
Open your heart and feel the Lord's embrace

He'll give you peace, just like he's done for me
If you believe, He will set you free
For that's the key that will open up the door
So you can dwell with the Lord forever more

"TOO OLD BLUES

I stayed home with my babes
All during their growing years
I ran my business on the phone
And was there to dry their tears
So that when they each would leave the nest
I could rest assured I'd given them my best
And now... my wings have come unfurled 
Have things I must inform the world
But those who hold the key
They keep on telling' me
Honey, you're too old

I've got the too old blues
Been hearing it far too long
It makes no sense... so it's time to scold
When I have so much to give
Why does it matter how long I've lived
I look and think and act young
Write unique songs that must be sung
I'm not useless, I'm strong and bold
So stop giving me those Too Old Blues

Worked so hard, saved some cash
Supported my loved ones dreams
Found energy to work on mine
And surprising as it seems
True friends took notice of my goals
Kept saying hey girl... you owe this to yourself
Pursue that dream while there's still time
Found the door and paid my dime
But those who hold the key
They keep on telling me
Honey, you're too old

Have songs to be sung
I'll never quit - I refuse

Years ago I got me a CB radio
So I'd be safer on the road at night
That's how I came to know a trucker, ""Jersey Joe""
The only man to ever treat me right

We agreed to meet at a diner one night
Where Joe pulled out the story of my life
He said,  ""You've been abused...your handle must be ""Blues""
Then six months later, Joe made me his wife

""Blues"" had been my handle
'Cause life had served me a handful of strife
""Blues"" had been my handle

Yeah, ""Blues"" had been my handle
'Til true love lit a candle
Now ""Joy"" is the handle I use

Oh, what fun to see the whole country with my man
I'm by his side on almost every trip
I sing a bluesy song, Joe loves to sing along
So happy that the two of us just click

Blues are now the songs I sing of other folks
'Cause I have filed away my painful past
Joe's brought me so much joy... I'm more than just his toy

(CHORUS)
                                                              
Mikey's quilt was for his birthday
He used to plead for Dad's in the worst way
Bad dreams would fade as Dad's quilt lay on his head
Grandma learned about this and hurriedly
Made a quilt for his own bed

(CHORUS) 
Oh, how I wish Grandma's quilts would last forever

"LIFE IS A 3-RING CIRCUS

(CHORUS)
Life is a 3-ring circus
Diverts our eyes, jerks us around
Disguises, surprises
We laugh at the clown
That's in all of us
Life is 3-ring circus

Take the first ring I ever received, came on a first date
Bobbie took me to the fair and called me ""baby""
The ruby ring was the top prize at the shootin' gallery
He won it for me but ""he"" turned out to be a lady,

CHORUS

Another ring was the day the phone rang  and I was told off
And called most every name you can imagine
My innocence went unnoticed 'cause I couldn't get a word in
I later learned a former tenant was the guilty one

CHORUS 

Ring number three appeared on my mahogany table
I screamed, ""Why didn't you kids use a coaster""
Turns out my friend next door was the one to blame
Well, I ate humble pie 'cause she replaced my old toaster

Laughter gets us through the crazy days
And it's true I have a surplus 
Life is a 3-ring circus

"THE  MAGIC  APRON

Granny wore an apron every single day
Whether baking in the kitchen or helping Pa with hay
It wiped away my tears, when I fell and skinned a knee
It played peek-a-boo with baby to make him squeal with glee

(CHORUS)
It was a magic apron
I never will forget
The many, many uses
Granny had for it

It held apples from the orchard, rhubarb from the patch 
And cradled baby chick as soon as they were hatched
Carried eggs from the henhouse, popcorn from the crib
It had two big pockets and of course, it had a bib

CHORUS

Carried eggs from the henhouse, popcorn from the crib
It had two big pockets and of course, it had a bib

"SOME DAY  YOU'LL  BE  OLD  TOO

A bent old lady attempts to get on the bus
And the high steps worsen her arthritic pain
No one offers to help and it's clear she heard
A few comments about her slowness as some complain
So remember  (spoken)

(CHORUS)
Some day you'll be old too
Give seniors the respect they are due
Don't poke fun or be cruel
Instead, obey the golden rule
Or this could come right back to you 
Remember...some day you'll be old too
	                
A son berates his Dad as he starts to speak
""There's just no way I'll listen to that once more""
It would have been so much kinder to have said
""That's a great story, Dad.. but I've heard it before""
Remember  (spoken)

CHORUS

Some day you'll be old too
Yes, you will   (spoken)
You'd want folks to be kind to you
Some day you'll be old too
Some day you'll be old too

"TAKE  OFF  THAT  FANCY  DRESS

Doncha know we had a date for the rodeo""

Take off that fancy dress

Put on your snake-skinned boots

We're goin' to the square danc 
To doe se doe
After the barrel racin' at the rodeo

Instead of that silly 'ole rodeo
It's gettin' so boring each Saturday night
Watching rope tyin', bull ridin' and cowboy fights""

Well I went and changed my clothes, but I thought (spoken)

NEW(CHORUS)
How come I never get to wear a fancy dress
He's got me livin' out here in the rugged west
One of these days I'm gonna put my foot down 
And make him take me to a dinner and show in town
						
He read my  mind 'cause he said? (spoken)

Take off those snake-skinned boots and faded blues
Put on your fancy dress and your high-heeled shoes

So I put on my fancy red dress, had to look my best

Pearls and earrings too; glad I changed into my fancy red dress
Oh, yes

"WHATEVER  HAPPENED TO NATHANIEL  STRONG

We had church basement parties 'cause dancin' was a sin
Home movies in the Deacon's den replaced the ole drive in
Back then I had a major crush I've been wonderin'

Whatever happened to Nathaniel Strong
The Pastor's son who filled my girlhood dreams
We shared singing and a strict upbringing
And to this day I remember our song
And I wonder (spoken)
Whatever happened to Nathaniel Strong

A couple we knew made out in back of Miller's Dam
They married quickly and soon were pushing a pram
They'd been better off at the movies, it seemed to us
But we followed the rules and didn't make a fuss

Daydreams back then about Nathaniel Strong
Made me forget the crazy rules
Now I know they taught us right from wrong

"WHEN I'M CHASING A DREAM

(CHORUS)
Chasing a dream keeps boredom at bay
When I'm chasing a dream
My work seems like play
And there's a reason to face each new day
When I'm chasing a dream
When I'm chasing a dream

Early on in life I was always dreaming
Never a day went by that I wasn't scheming
One wish came true I'll not forget 
The day I became a majorette

Lying in bed I'd dream of the man I'd marry
Later I thought of the child I'd some day carry
Blessed with both, but needed more from life
Than being a mother and a wife

CHORUS 
 
My goal these days is to be a hit songwriter
A little success has made the challenge lighter
And if I set my sights sky high
This dream could last until I die

CHORUS

(BRIDGE)
When I've given all I've got to give
And a rainbow's no longer in view
That's when I'll know for certain
It's time to close the curtain
And find something new to pursue

New ones may come unforeseen.. but
I'll always be chasing a dream

"(WHY  DONCHA)  KISS  ME  LIKE  THAT

Tell me Honey, why do ya leave for a snack 
Right when you see there's a passionate kiss
'A comin' on TV
Well, the next time it happens I'm callin? you back
To take a good look and answer me..
Why doncha kiss me like that

(CHORUS)
Why doncha kiss me like that
Just like when we were dating
Why doncha kiss me like that
I'm ready, willing and waiting
Oh, how I'm anticipating
The day you kiss me like that
	
Last week we saw that couple in the town square
After a tender kiss they lingered in each other's arms
So turned off, you insisted we leave then and there
The fire in my heart had four alarms
You were totally unaware

Now before you kiss my lips
Listen up honey to these few tips (spoken)
Kiss my eyelids, neck and nose
Kiss my fingertips and toes
And feel my temperature rise 
When your lips touch those

When I wake up I think I'm dreaming
When you're sleeping next to me
You're the one who makes me seem so great
With you I'm all that I can be
You make me feel I can do anything
You make me know it will be fine
I push a little farther and a little harder
I'm so lucky you are mine

(CHORUS)
You make me shine
Every single day in a special kind of way
You make me shine
There are things that I can do
Just because of loving you
You make me shine 
      			
When I'm at work I must stay focused
There's so much I have to do
If my mind wonders to happy thoughts
I am always back with you
It doesn't matter what we're doing
Because with you it's always fine
You pump me up to win,  then I'm ready to begin
I'm so lucky you are mine

When I come home my heart beats faster
It's that pretty face I see
My days are brighter because of you
A new world with much to see
What did I do to have this blessing
Having you here in my life
Whatever I did I would do it all again
But this time I'd do it twice

"CHURCH CALLED THE RISEN SON
(""House of the Risin' Sun"" melody)

There is a church outside of town
It's called the risen son
The builder had great plans but died
Before the inside was done

Brother Ben carved God's commandments
In marble on ten walls
Was centered on a wooded lot
Far from shopping malls

Now this strategy using ten walls
Formed a definite decagon
The most unusual church around
Though Ben's gone, it lives on

[Instrumental]
The lovely stained glass skylight
Shows the Savior with a smile
His arms are reaching heavenward
Rising from the golden tile

Oh, I love to go inside that church
Even though it's not complete
I find such peace and solace there
As I pray, standing 'neath his feet

Perhaps this church called the risen son
In the Father's eyes is done
No pulpit or pews are needed there
To pray to Him, one on one

Oh, how I love to worship Him there
In the Church Called the Risen Son

My life is filled with untraveled roads
A map of special  places where I've never been
And where I'm bound, grace only knows
Amazingly,  shows me how to begin

I can't see it, but it's always there
I can't earn it, still it's close as a prayer
It goes far beyond the rainbow's end
The Lamb's blood flowed
Now GRACE is my friend

No humble Hannah, life was a game
I had to be in charge and call each shot
I sped in high gear on a fast freight train
'Til GRACE appeared and changed the plot

Opportunity's window saw me through  
I raced down a one-way street

That with His love I would be complete

True balance is something I've struggled with all my grown up life
I wanted to use my talents, yet be a good wife
I'm torn between Mary and Martha in all I do
I want to pray more, Lord, but my work kept me from you

(CHORUS)
Seems like Mary & Martha seldom agreed
As they tried to please you and see to your needs
I'm a mixture of Mary & Martha
And I always will be
Jesus, I beg you... please accept me for me 

Mary  and Martha showed gracious hospitality
They both served faithfully, yet differently
Martha cooked and kept their home fresh as an ocean breeze
Mary washed your feet and listened, while on her knees

Being the best I can be and serving you to the end

You know my needs, Lord, even before I ask
You show an easier way to do a difficult task
When worries come like a thief in the night
The hope you give puts up an excellent fight

Oh, Lord, your faithfulness
Restores my faith
Making it never-ending
Like a river flowing out to sea
You keep it ever growing 
Like the rings on an old oak tree
Your faithfulness restores my faith

When trouble comes I know you're always there
You've never given me more to handle than I could bear
And thanks to you my life is fulfilled
Adversity threatens, but I can say 'yield'

To write any more blues
Until we've written our own love song

She had big plans when she moved to town
Seemed so happy, you'd never see her frown
Everyone she met became a friend
No one knew she had a broken heart
That needed to mend	

She dug in her heels and found success
The locals in her field are not impressed
Still she smiles and tries to please
Though treated like she has a contagious disease

She has a heart on a rampage
Her smile's a restless disquise
That heart on a rampage
Is reflected in her eyes
Torn apart and filled with rage
Heart on a rampage

She sometimes wonders if she's to blame
Forgives and protects the cause of the pain
She knows she's put on permanent hold		
Because of well-deserved success and can't be consoled

The rest of the world has nothing but praise
It's a mystery why she stays
In a town that shows no respect
Her kindness belies the anger that's slow to detect

Torn apart and filled with rage
Heart on a rampage

Heart on a rampage (4 times ... fade on last one)

To say I'm sorry and start anew
But if you're angry enough to say goodbye
Then I promise not to cry
And won't even try to deny
I played a leading part
In breaking both our hearts
So if you're man enough to stay
I'll be woman enough to play
By the rules of love

I didn't value what I had
That your star shone brighter than the rest
Then I put my love to the test
Now  I know that you're the best
And my thoughts just focus now on you
It seems the joke is now on me
'Cause I'm the one who's blue

Gave up my car and my old southern home
Thought life with you would beat my bein' alone

You dumped me on your mama, hey that's a load
I worked to feed your kids; you paid for your truck
No money for six months; you said ""tough luck""

Too many years now I've been on my own
You've given me much grief & pain & it's not right

Leave me alone  (spoken)
Just leave me alone

Why do you always call from out of town
And bring up hurts that really cut me down
Then after each uncalled-for bitter fight
I toss and turn and worry half the night
	
You lied and beat me up when times were rough
You must believe that I've had enough
No need to write sad notes or beg on the phone
Why don't you just give up and leave me alone

You were always there for me
I had it all;  Now it's clear

And I fear my heart might burst	
The spiteful words you choose

When our love is going right it's a rare surprise
My heart just wants to soar
You lift me to staggering heights of paradise
That I've never known before

Then when one thing goes wrong, oh baby
We let it keep hangin' around
Why can't we stay on top and start leaving
The grief scattered on the ground

[Chorus:]
Our love is like a roller coaster ride
We fly so high we almost reach the sky
But when we're starting to descend
It looks like it's all gonna end
We go round,  round, up and down 
And our hearts are caught up in the slide
Here we go climbing that hill once more
Our love is like a roller coaster ride  

Didn't you say the sweetest thing, oh darlin'
It was just the other night
You promised to buy me a ring so sparklin'
Right before we had that fight

Can't we just agree this time, oh baby
Why does it matter who has to pay
Let's make up and hasten our climb, then maybe
On top is where we'll stay

[Chorus]

Here we go climbing that hill once more
Our love is like a roller coaster ride  

We go round & round, up & down

How many shades of blue
Are you gonna dish me out today
How many shades of blue
Before I kiss you goodbye and say
This is the way it's gotta be
I'm leavin'...doncha see
You've played with my heart too long
Your many shades of blue
Have only made me strong

Powder blues' the color used
To describe my milder shade of blue
Ever since the day we met
Even then you made me fret
And sky blues' the color of your eyes
The very ones that told me tons of lies

(CHORUS)

Royal is the brightest blue
That one proved my loyalty to you
Like a puppet you could mold
I would melt 'til you turned cold
I found aqua blues' your fickle side
Walked in and out of my life just like the tide

(CHORUS)

The darkest shade was navy blue
That was when I waved goodbye to you
I was watchin' from the train
You were standin' in the rain
There was nothing more that you could do
You'd given me too many shades of blue

Too many shades of blue

"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more 

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I'll love you more",7
"It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the hall
And eat your heart out
And cry your eyes out
And rack your brains

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she
Should cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven
But I'm only up a tree
Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain.

You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as he

Now this has been one hell of a year
This has been one hell of a ride, I'm tellin' you guys
They'd thought we'd never survive, Jeky'll and Hyde

Dead or alive, left with no choice but to um, better our lives
Get up and strive, but um, get up and roll, get up ya know
Get up and go, these motherfuckers ain't lettin' us go 
So we get up and take it, get up and make it happen for us
Nobody can gt up and take this

Part of my waist yup, pardon my waist chump
For this part of my waist chump, come part in of your face, yup

Uh, Santana, let's do it
Yeah, DipSet

[Verse 1 - Juelz Santana]
Man where ever I go, I hold it down
I blow it down, you see me, believe me it's (Going down)
These hoes love me to death, they mumble under they breath
Lovely duets, boy, I'm (Going down)
I thought Mary J. was under my steps, nah I'm just playing
Love when ya sweat, keep singing (Going down)
I'm so fucking amazin, like Jordan to the league
When he first came in, it's (Going down)
I know you mad, my career's blowing up
Going up, holding up, and your's is (Going down)
Slowly but surely, so coked to the shorty's
Caught by the boys, the judge says your (Going down)
I had to call up my lawyer, gotta make court
And yawning, it's four in the morning, it's (Going down)
I need be out by the morning
Man the police need me to be out by the morning, or nothings (Going down)

[Chorus - Juelz Santana]
Yeah, I tryed to help ya, tryed to warn ya
Tryed to tell ya it's (Going down)
But, wouldn't believe it, couldn't believe it
Look I succeded, it's (Going down)
Baby keep walking wit ya hip, I keep walking wit a limp
Yeah you talking to a pimp it's (Going down)
Again, I tryed to help ya, tryed to warn ya
Tryed to tell ya it's (Going down)

[Verse 2 - Juelz Santana]
Now look, I'm back stronger than ever
Money's longer than ever, longer Baretta, it's (Going down)
Man we could get it on, it's whatever
The morns the better, I'm shorter, I'm better whenever it's (Going down)
Got a new chick, badder than ever
Ass fatter than ever, got it together and love (Going down)
No bud, no kiss, no hug
No rub, no bath, no tub, just love (Going down)
Yeah, that's my kind of baby
That's my kind of lady it's (Going down)
And the purse, you might find a eighty
Underneath her lip gloss, shorty keeps some lip gloss she's (Going down)
And that's why I love her, that's also why I don't trust her
Think she got her a sucker, nope (Going down)
Got another thing coming, not a baby but a
{???} believe me I done it (Going down)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Juelz Santana]
Yeah, mama look at me now, mama look at me how
Ya beautiful child it's (Going down)
Mama look up and smile, you made a beautiful child
Still shooting the pound it's (Going down)
Gotta survive, maneuver through towns
Gotta drive, smooth through the town, or it's (Going down)
Cops on my ass, gotta shoot through the town
Shooting the pound, I ruined it now it's (Going down)
Only question is, will I get caught
Will I get cuffed, will I see court, will people see me (Going down)
No they won't, man I'ma survivor
Plus I gotta lady cop that's a rider, so nothing's (Going down)
You might catch me, crossing the border
Crossing the water, three ladies out and deported it's (Going down)

Okay it's Santana, I'm back again
You know what man? What? What?

The streets my heart you can't get it out me, it's
You fuckas know me, it was a sharp throb in my bones
I looked it was my own flesh, heart, and my bones, problems at home (Home)
So I left them there, got up out the atmosphere
Misery, loves company, I don't respect that there
Dip Set on the posta, boy for coming so close to
Being the black Lagrosta Nostra

We are the Dip family, get a grip family
Nothin alive can divide this family
So come on roll with the Set, come on roll with the best
The pain is felt niggaz know that you stressed (Oh)
The game itself don't notice your stress
You been left smokin, zoning on steps (No)
That's not the way to go, but that's the way you'll go
If you don't get up off you ass and find a way to go
Streets to rap, yea that's the way I went
Now its beats and rhymes, that's the way I pay the rent
Fuck what ya think nigga
Cause this is..

You?
Who wishin', who frontin', who want it from me?

Do you believe me?
Don't you believe me, won't you believe me?

On any given Sunday or any given Monday
We headed up the runway
Uptown yea we headed up a one-way, her head is in my lap
So I let her do her one thang
She was Jamaican so I fed her bread and dumplings
Veggie pads and rumcake
Told her, said she's 18 and lived crazy just like me

Eighties baby just like me so
Hey baby you know what your boy holds all night
Long pipe, long strokes

They'll get you, they'll twist you
They'll split ya whole body in half
Then dismiss you like

But I'm lookin' for a bad lil' mama
Get mad like her papa, got an ass like her mama
Got her own, won't ask for a dollar
Go half on a scama and will laugh when I holla

"[Verse]
I make music I consider a challenge
Like this here, reminds me of Gilligan's Island
And that reminds of Harlem, where my niggaz is whylin
The only borough that was built on an island, woah
You fucks probably ain't know, if they cut off the bridges
We'd be stuck, forced to live on the Island
But we gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Niggaz still want beef than holla
You think you bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
A young Muhammad Atta, no plane lessons, cocaine lessons, just a plot of towers
Before they crashed and divided the towers
I'm hurtin' working hard to reprovide the towers, like
Bring 'em back up, lift 'em back up
Niggaz back up, or lift us back up

[Chorus: 2x]
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Y'all can't fuck with me, okay

[Verse]
Now let me hear you say, OKAY
It's Santana the great again, tie him up, bandana his face again
I tried to tell 'em it's no escaping the basics
And no escaping the hatred and no escaping the matrix man
Only Neo is me, no Cleo can see my future, if she did I'd shoot her
They tried to say the mission was impossible
I came through, crew did it, got it poppin' too
Two bitches on my side both prostitutes
Gray smoke, mobster's suit, yeah they get it poppin' too
I get my ace holes chopped in two, dimes, quarters, rocks in two
The fiends cop it too
Yeah, look at 'em rockin' two, rockin' boat, Rock n' Jock
Stop and plot, hot a BLDAT
Fucka, this nigga gotta stop, out of sight, out of mind
He gotta go, he out of line

[Chorus: 2x]
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, Okay, Okay
Okay, Okay, Okay
Y'all can't fuck with me, OKAY",6
" 

(Verse)
Now once again, a deep thought of Aaliyah
Crosses my mind, I rethought that I seen her, all in my mind
Memories of Big, all in the lime light, all of the time, all on his grind, right
I'm blacking out about 'Pac, blacking out on them cops
Middle finger, after blacking out from them shots
And I go visit Shyne, in my distant mind
I tell him stay up, cause in there it's a different grind
I see Eazy and Jam Master laughin'
Big L still rappin, like it never happened
I got a sick sense with me, God picked then sent me
To this earth place, to win in the first place
Visions of mommy, on an Island somewhere, yeah, I designed just for my mommy
My whole life is a blessing, that's why I'm so nice, so right
Approach mics with aggression
I got the type of obsession I would like to progress in
I write about me, and the life of my henchmen
I blow dice, roll twice to the deuce
That was nights, that was life on the stoop
This shit gotta change
Can't forget the hard white in the boot
White car stripped with the blue, narc parked right in the coup, damn
They riding around with a license to shoot
I'm riding around with no license and hoop, follow me now
Follow me down, this yellow brick road
187, hello, every ghettos zip code
I had to change my pace up, so I went left, while everybody went right
Had to switch the waste up, now I'm better off
Met Cam set it off, did the mix tape now look dip set is off
Put the bid in Def Jam bet it all
First writers refusal, Dame wouldn't let us off
So we matched it, we signed labels with Dashius
Cam goes platinum, the set is up next
A double album, we set for the best
Juelz is the test, which is me, fail or succeed
But still I'm here in the flesh, handing you breath
Mixed with a lot of thought, The Santana, Robb Report
I bring you more than just music I bring you me and all of my movement
I bring my whole life all in the booth shit
And I'm all in the booth with, the headphones on, the lights cut down
And all of this true shit",5
"Ya probably ain't expecting this one
Nope,yea clap clap un hun,
This something my grandmother would dance to or something
Sha ba doop doop doo
Sha ba doop doop doo

[Chorus]
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall
(i know you wishing it would rain)
Nights like this I wish
That rain drop would fall

Ay Grandma and Grandpa
Look at ya grandson, I done made it far
Damn nana, I know its killing ya bones that damn cancer
I wish I had an answer,but I don't I'm jus wishin for an answer
Watchin my mamma cry, she's watchin her mamma die
Every second I'm drying my mamma eyes, she so proud of her son
See right through my mamma eyes, she jus follow the drips
You can't dodge the rain but you can follow the drips
And every drop of rain that falls, has a drop a pain involved,you better believe
88 cocaine it solves, now the dope came in charge yup
I see my niggaz for what they really are,what we really are
The dips we really are, let it rain

[Chorus]

It has been long fights like this
Long days ,long nights nights like this
I'm wishing for rain. Nothing but the wind ever came
Little girls with they skirt up, the world's getting worser
Man I twirled through the world in a roaster
Twirling the smoke up, I be so high
Shit a week goes by, I still think the week just started
Man weed still sparking,still in tune with the street man
He still sparking, go ahead nigga leap feel frogish
These streets I harnish, my peeps my partners
Cam, Jim, Zeek my sponsors, black, griz, snags my monstrous
Paper, drugs, twin my archor. Robs, 40, doe, guard
Bus, train and go hard, let it rain

[Chorus]

This is a story,about a young boy wishin' for glory
Rap, riches and glory. some people I'll love to share it with
Yea my people my thugs I'll share it with.
You can't eat through this love I'm dealing with
You can't see through this love I'm dealing with
You can't be through or eat through this love I'm dealing with
Its real I'm feeling it my niggaz. cats plan on killing it
Rats real I'm realing it all men like fishermen
Say(hey hey hey baby)
Drive sticks while sticking em, young chicks I'm dicking 'em
All down and yea they all down
But why it got to be like this, why every girl I meet got to be like this
Let it rain

[Chorus]

Let it rain
I'm just sitting here
Wishing it would rain
I'm just sitting here waiting for the rain
Waiting for the rain",6

Hit the gas, now we rich with cash
And when I hear Squalie!

Cooked more caine, push off dames
While you dumb niggaz stand there
And look all lame
I done popped and took off chains
Now Ivory dump ice on me like my team
Won a football game!",5
"My baby don't mess around not mine
Because she loves me so 
And this I know fo sho 
But does she really want to 
But can't stand to see me 
Walk out the door

Cause the thought alone

Thank god for mom and dad 
For stickin together 
Cause we don't know how

"My name mean a lot to me, pain mean a lot to me
Fame means nothing, but the game means a lot to me
I slang caine on these blocks for weeks
Ever since Rocky III, and the death of Apollo Creed
I was a tiny little poppy seed
As grimey as I could be, as sheiesty as I could be
Niggaz who live nicely, who don't understand the life of me
Other niggaz don't like me, and wanna take my life from me
They don't understand that I love it, and I like the beef
The raw, the guns, the violence, it's all right with me
I be laying in the cut where the sniper be
Righteously, waiting for you to get out the driver's seat
I don't think like usual people
Who think like usual people, who don't think right
I think like Muslims, in movements of people, who move they people
And move on your people, power is stronger than voo doo and evil
I'm immune, I drunk the juice, took a root from the needle
Still trying to figure out, why I do, the crimes I do
With the minds IQ, of an Einstein too
Tell 'em, Cha-cha, and bon, bon goo, they think I'm crazy, well I do too
Leave me alone please, I'm in my two-three zone please
Nothing can stop me, you fuckers can't stop me

[""Why"" continues to play]

[Verse 2]
It's like my life keeps turning around
Every second I need a lighter, I keep burning it down
I smoke so much, I could nurture a pound
My thoughts are always foggy, they blurring right now listen
I see the game for what it's worth, pain, fame and work
Girls walk with they brain in their skirt
So while you're fucker, they thinking
Of ways to get even, or a way out the hood, they make up a reason
For the judge, for you take him and see him
Until you face a subpena, that'll change your demeanor
So be careful, where you skating through this game
Remember it's other niggaz playing, skating in your lane
Don't get clipped, or stripped skating in the rain
Cause niggaz will keep rolling, and skating on your brain
That's just the rules and regulations of the game
When you playing you, you playing, and you paying like you weigh in, so..
If not, those wolves aiming where you layin'
And waiting on you patient with that thing up in the basement
That's why I walk with that thing out, when I'm pasting
Cause I know these niggaz hate it, that their little sisters love it
And their girls really want it, plus I'm frontin
Twenty three big truckin, new Z, new bucket
Fuck it

And if I die then my child'll be a bastard

Back to you son, as for you son,

From the dirtiest diaper, till you get old enough to dirty your nikes up,

You ever need a hand, need a foot, need a heart, need a lung,
Reach for the phone, call me up son,

Look at his face, its just like mine, wow,
Damn, this kid shines,
Authority and prioritys, this kids mine, so,
That means I gotta beat him if I have to,
Keep him out of bad schools, teach him how to rap smooth,
Show him the ropes like, make sure his rope's tight,
No screws loose, no loose screws,
Got manners, got morals, got sense of respect,
Cause when you gone, boy that's all you got left,
You ever get craze for candy, don't take a strangers candy,
Open a strangers candy, those are the strangest candys,
I'm your rider, your guider, pusher, provider,
But most of all I'm your father and I'm just looking out for you,
When there's a problem, man I'm just looking out for you,
I'm not talking man, I'm just pulling out for you,
The ford, a sword, the hood'll come out for you,
And what I'm about to do, you shouldn't go out and do,
You just make sure your good to me, you good to mom,
Respect your elders, you grow to be good and strong,

[Chorus]

I raise you up in the sky, like behold,
The only thing greater then I, YOU, my greatest achievement,
Fuck a platinum plaque, this is history in the making, believe it,
Without you I can't make or succeed shit,
I can't think, I can't wake up and eat shit,
You the reason, that I'm breathin',
And I will stop at any moment to see this, child live a better life,
Wow its a better life, but you better throw down if you ever fight,
Like Rocky do, don't be no punk when its time to get up and put on your boxing shoes,
You lace em up tight, you fall, get up fight,
You lose, oh well, we all lose some fights,
Just be a man about yours, life is all about handling yours,
So you just keep handling yours.

But most of all I'm your father and I'm just looking out for you,
When there's a problem, man I'm just looking out for you,
I'm not talking man, I'm just pulling out for you,
The ford, a sword, the hood'll come out for you,
And what I'm about to do, you shouldn't go out and do,
You just make sure your good to me, you good to mom,
Respect your elders, you grow to be good and strong,

[Chorus]

I raise you up in the sky, like behold,
The only thing greater then I, you, my greatest achievement,
Fuck a platinum plaque, this is history in the making, believe it,
Without you I can't make or succeed shit,
I can't think, I can't wake up and eat shit,
You the reason, that I'm breathin',
And I will stop at any moment to see this, child live a better life,
Wow its a better life, but you better throw down if you ever fight,
Like Rocky do, don't be no punk when its time to get up and put on your boxing shoes,
You lace 'em up tight, you fall, get up fight,
You lose, oh well, we all lose some fights,
Just be a man about yours, life is all about handling yours,
So you just keep handling yours.

[Chorus]",5
"I don't feel the suns comin' out today
Its staying in, its gonna find another way.
As I sit here in this misery, I don't
Think I'll ever see the sun from here.

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and say, and they'll say,
Hey look at him! I'll never live that way.
But that's okay
They're just afraid to change.

When you feel your life ain't worth living 
You've got to stand up and
Take a look around you then a look way up to the sky.
And when your deepest thoughts are broken, 
Keep on dreaming boy, cause when you stop dreamin' it's time to die.

And as we all play parts of tomorrow,
Some ways will work and other ways we'll play.
But I know we all can't stay here forever, 
So I want to write my words on the face of today.
And then they'll paint it

And oh as I fade away, 
They'll all look at me and they'll say, 
Hey look at him and where he is these days.
When life is hard, you have to change.",5

Old timer want the block back, stop that
You been gone too long the young nigga said
Lord knows, what's goin through this young niggaz head
As the old timer stood and grilled him
Pissed off, shorty looked at his man
Touched his burner like I shoulda killed him
Shorty in deep, but hew don't care
But he don't know, these old timers don't play fair
There he go, postin on his strip again
Toast on him, niggaz wit 'em, posted on his shit again
(Uh-Oh) He actin like it can't and it won't happen
Old timer bout to blow dust off that old cabinet
(Thats,that's,Thats) Where dem guns is kept
These young niggaz better show some respect (respect)
I'll Teach 'em a lesson, he said to his self
As he proceeded to pull the lead from his shelf
Now he headed towards shorty block, forty cocked
On his zip, on his shit, like he don't care who shorty wit
But somebody saw him, before he go to shorty
Shorty phone ring, somebody called him
Somebody warned him, he's comin he's comin
Shorty replied, somebody stall him
Then he crept up wit his goons and guns
Whispered in to old timers ear, death is soon to come

They say hell is hot,but is heaven cold
Know one ever knows til you Gone, gone, gone

And when you gone does ya soul drift off to a better place
Or do you jus float up and fade
Away,away,away,away, like a bird when its headed towards the sky (huh, huh)
Or do you just die (huh huh)
Or do you just perish from the earth and its over

Listen kid, I need a mountain of cash
So I could roll up, hop in the whip and like, bounce to the ave
I get high cause I'm in the hood, the guns is around
It take a blunt, just to ease the pain that humbled me now (whew)
And I'd rather roll somethin' up; cause if I'm sober dog
I just might flip, grab my guns and hold somethin' up
I get high as a kite; I'm in the zone all alone
Motherfucker case I'm dyin' tonight (it happen tonight)
So I roll 'em up, back to back, fat as I could (uh-huh)

I get high when, bullets hit faces after words exchanged
I get a rush, off the blood on the walls, you understand?

'Cause I'mma bury these niggas this time around

Who better than me, you better than me
Shit you never will see if you dead and deceased
Keep two', lead, and the piece and I'm busting it off right
Leave a trail of smoke like a fucking exhaust pipe
Took the coke up out the stash cause they know about the stash
Now I'm like swallow these dope up in the bags
Coke up in the bags, yeah sown up in the bags 
I do my chicks like Ludacris blow it out your ass
I'm a mean pimp you know what I mean pimp
Four hoes on each strip all bringing me chips

Just to prove I'm this sick

For ever thinking you'll be greater than I'll be
You get that short late waist pack money 
I get that all straight a.s.a.p. money bring it here now!

Touch the coke, touch the pot, add the soda what you got me!
I am what I am I be what I be and that you will see I am crack!!

Who want it with I you want it with I 
I'll shoot one of ya eyes
You'll lose one of ya eyes
I'll jam move and slump ya
Leave your body in ranch cuckamonga with ants moving under
My flows so in order I can turn soap and water to ocean water and float the border
You never will be what I forever will be 
Your tombstone never will read we buried a G nope!!
I'm so mean and nice with the things I write 
Jesus might say Jesus Christ
It's only rap so why y'all trying to hold me back
Like y'all ain't ask for to owe me back I'm here!
My peoples play and sling cocaine
More than Billy Blanco from Carlito's Way
So you can find me on the streets okay 
With that big fucking piece okay

Too dope for this but you won't admit 
So my two's smoking spit make you choke on spit
You ever seen a man gag and gargle
Sound like a new born trying to ask for bottles 
They like cut it out you slacking
But I bust it out in rapping 
Can you name a nigga better without me busting out in laughing?
Nigga you couldn't spit enough to get at me 
I'll stretch ya for extracurricular activity
I'm more macing than grace is when I say shit
You should say amen after my name kid
Yes this is that of greatest
You should say amen after this statement

Nah
Yeah, yeah leave the hissin in, Don't take the hissin out
We gon keep this one all the way gangsta
I mean, you mutha fuckas don't realize, how real this shit is man
I mean, people always gonna try and get over on you
But protect what's yours, protect your family, protect what's right
Ya Dig! 

The story starts off, lil boy black in the ghetto
No matter what he does it's back to the ghetto (ghetto)
No choice but to adapt to the ghetto
So he adapts the ghetto
Yes, the crack and the metal
He took no days off, for gettin this cocaine off
He ran back and forth so much he pissed Jose off
Now Jose was the cocaine boss
Straight from Columbia, his cocaine soft
But Jose was out fuckin his sister
Hittin shorty off 'cause' he had love for his sister
And shorty had no love for his sister 'cause' sister was sniff up everything Jose gives her
But shorty had a plan for them both
'cause' he was good at handlin coke and Jose liked that
Problem was, he was pitchin for the dudes down the street
You know, Cj, Big Boo, and Meleke
Meleke was a killa, Boo was a killa
Cj, well he's just anotha nigga
Despite the fact, they didn't like the fact, that he was close to Jose and he might just rat
And bein that he was a bitch and he ain't know when its here
They set it up to get him there n hit him there
But shorty was smart, so before they got to load up n spark he said hold up my heart
Please, then he said Please, look up in my bag, there's cook up in my bag
It's all good up in my bag
And there's more where that came frome
It came from Jose, believe me there's more where that caine from
So they let him go thinkin he would tell them where Jose kept the heavy coke
But instead he told Jose bout that
And we all know Jose bout that
Next thing we know we see Jose slouch back
And he said there's no way out that
He said shoot em ima blow they house back
Next day Jose sent the 2-way out town
And next minute someone blew they house down
Jose think shorty on his side
But he don't know shorty on his side
So shorty called Jose, like listen, it's going down I need more cocaine
So they met up, it was a set up
Guess who? Cj, Meleke and Boo speed up
You shoulda seen the look on old man's face
You neva seen a look on no man's face
Told him no mans great, and it's no man's place
To fuck with no man's fam
And he said where's my sister before I kill you
The End

[Outro]
The story's over man (over man)
They all kinda end like that man, ya dig
You see, I told this story because I kinda feel like, every hood, everybody, everybody gotta lil boy fresh and them somewhere
Weither it's right next door, across the hall
Up the block, down the block, around the corner
I mean, you see, you see we all see the same shit, just through diffent eyes
You surprised? Don't be man, It's just real shit
Holla at ya boy dipset, AYE!",5

Boy let me show ya how to make that crack
How to spend that money how to make that back

How to get that dick don't give back lip
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
Go head do what you do make it work for ya
Go head do what you do make it work for ya

How to get that shit how to twist that wrist
I can show you how to get back more
And the shit that you get back is just as raw
Girl I can show you how to hit that Ave
With that big fat ass and go get that cash
But you know you got to give back half
I'm somethin' like a pimp man go get that cash
Boy I don't play when it comes to money
I guess that's why I'm okay when it comes to money
I got two coups a truck and one four door
I can pick up all my hoes and have a one four org

Copped ten sold five then I hide three
Baking soda residue I'm gone with the other two

They call it murder

[Juelz Santana + (sample)]
Up (in the street)
Gun tucked (in the street)
Niggaz front (in the street)
Get bucked and (they call it murder)
Up (in the street)
Gun tucked (in the street)
Buck buck and (they call it murder)

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Murder, murder, mu-murder, murder, mu-murder these streets (I'm 'bout to)
Murder, murder, mu-murder, murder, mu-murder these streets (I'm 'bout to)
Murder, murder, mu-murder, murder, mu-murder these streets (I'm 'bout to)
Murder, murder, mu-murder, murder, mu-murder these streets

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
I stay up
My gun tucked
I gives a fuck
So, welcome to jamrock
No, welcome to my damn block
Where the slugs and cans pop
For the ones and tan rocks
Kids play in the sandbox
Other kids
Lay in boxes with sandtops
You can't stop this
Murder, murder, mu-murder, murder, mu-murder shit, this
Servin', servin', se-servin', servin', se-servin' bricks, we
Purchase, purchase, pu-purchase, and purchase, purchase whips, we
Swervin, swervin, sw-swervin, swervin, on purpose, bitch
Try to stop me, you ain't, kid
Try to pop me, you can't live
If so, you'll need an oxygen tank, shit
And for those bucks
I'm no punk
I'm Scarface, coked up, you know what
[sniff] I think I need another hit
[sniff] You know who you fuckin' with

[Chorus - 2X]

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
I bang
I slang
My nuts hang, yup
So don't get it confused or fucked up
My dudes will jump up
The ruger, dump dump, bup bup
And (they call it murder)
Act stupid, the gat's shootin [gunshot]
We'll leave you there, leave you square
Box style, box style, he who dares (dares)
Don't play
Be calm now, calm down 'cause
We all know you're not a killa killa gorilla, man
Y'all know I get that scrilla scrilla f'reala, fam
Catch me in the chinchilla all through the winter, man
Never catch me trippin', slippin', and kill me, damn
I show the hood love
They show me love back
And the hood is where my heart is, so I love that
Nah, you can't keep a black man down
I'm worldwide, Harlem's own, Manhattan bound
AY

[Chorus - 2X]

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
Killa, killa, more killin' killin' for killa killa
Feel the deal, the chinchillas, they can fit on gorillas
Santana, bananas, clip bananas, wrapped in bandannas
Hammers, hammers, no cameras, you'll be runnin to nana (nana nana)
Nana nana Santana, he be holding berettas
Killa killa kills civilians, you know I'm no better
Mo' betta' betta', cheddar cheddar, you'll be dead on your lever
For cheddar cheddar, heads we sever, go get it together
Get it together, now now get my pape's right
Come through late night
I know what it tastes like (what's that?)
Some good coke, dawg, go get your face pipe
Put on my Laker jersey, then I go rape white (number 8)
You got G ma, I got G too, shit
She wanna fly G-4, won't fly G-2 (nope)
Need ten thousand, you won't get a G, boo
Only G you gettin' is me, O.G., trueness

"[Intro]
Man, first I just wanna salute my soldiers
Knahmean? We just trying to stay above water
Feel me? I mean I speak for the Gs, the hustlers
They understand me, knahmsayin?
Shit
Lock into this time and lock out (always)
I mean ain't nothing promised to niggaz like us
You know?

[Juelz Santana]
Just a, another day another dollar
Now look what you got
Another hater, another plotter
Shit, you know the drill
A brother pay, a brother holla
Watch 'em, they creeping
Another raid, another copper
Aw man
Another case, another lock-up
What
Another bail, know that cake better pop up
Yup
That's just day to day shit we go through
And results of the day to day shits we go through
Some niggaz day to day pitch, they local, and
Some niggaz day to day bricks, they coastal, and
Some niggaz day to day snitch, they vocal
I don't honor them fools
Them type of dudes get they tonsils removed
I speak from the heart of the hood
From the boarded up apartments with wood
From the cracked down crack houses (yeah)
To the burnt up black houses
To fiends inside with that burnt up glass out
And puffing weed makes my actions switch
I'm at the window, with the pistol, like Malcolm
Ain't that a bitch (man)
And I'm paranoid, paranoid
But still I got to get it, got to have it, make it happen boy

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take
And may this song play all the way
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me
And if it skip a beat, hit repeat
This the realest shit I ever wrote, this is me

[Juelz Santana]
Look now
Another dead, another born
Vice versa
Another here, another gone
Pay attention
Another smile, another mourn
Another funeral, another baby shower going on
Get it, huh
That's just life in the hood
You earn scars, you earn stripes in the hood
Huh, get it
I live the life of a hustler
No sleep all night for a hustler, buster
And if your coke weak, cut it with Bo Peep sheep
I swear fiends will chase that high for four weeks
I'm still dealing with the day to day beef and
Stress, hunger, patience
The day to day basics
Yep, shit that we go through, you know
Shit
Look at the shit that we go through, you know
Niggaz come home, can't get jobs
Niggaz getting money, acting like they can't get robbed
And that don't mix

Put 'em to bed now

Grip to it, kick to it
Fuck that, spit to it
Sorry people, party people
This ain't kids' music
Nope
This is violence (violence, violence)
This is violence (violence)
Violence

The champ is back
Yup
This is my anthem track
Yup
This wasn't made for to dance or for your hands to clap
This that
Gutter, gutter motherfucker Ay
This that
Get your knife, time to gut a motherfucker Ay
They hand you the snub
Dismantle your mug
A head shot have you looking like you shampoo with blood
The vandalous thugs
The scandalous thugs
That go to your block, piss on the spot where your candle's put up
This ain't no damn push music
Or no hammish (?) music
This ain't party time it's army time
Ambush music
This that cripple fly, kill a guy, full blown gorilla-fied
Don't go in the club if you can't get your clip inside music
This that half a pound, back 'em down, ask around
Nobody say nuttin', cause they know they gon' get gatted down music
That pop and squeeze, lots of screams, guess what
Coppers, we ain't never forgot about Rodney King music

[Chorus]

Let's get ready to rumble (yup)
This that gritty, gritty for shizzy y'all (yup)
For shizzy, nizzy, I'll kill a nigga, he piss me off (Ay)
Heat him down, keep the pound, see him now, beat him down
I ain't talkin' 'bout a bush when I say he'll get beat around music
He ain't actin' right, grab and fight, stab him right
Show dude old school snatches at taxes night
Sip sizzurp, smoke weed, x up, coke, please
Dope fiends, get a load of this new codeine
That music, crack music, peel a nigga cap to it
No reason at all
This music is that stupid (Ay)
It's the code of silence (no it's)
Spoken silence
Right now I am promoting violence (Ay)
Why shouldn't I get the vest and spit the thing (Ay)
When y'all promote cigarettes and nicotine (Ay)
And y'all hope we stop it
Y'all told me stop it
Y'all the ones that keep promoting violence (Ay)

[Chorus]

This the shit that the gangstas love
Stomp out a gang of bud
Squeeze off a gang of slugs
We gotta vacate the club music
That's how the gangstas does
Shanking O.J., a thug
Go get your glock, and let it pop
Just like Bacon does music
We the few left that does what we do best
This here, get clear
Illegal in the U.S.
I overdosed the injection that leave you posted and deaded
This so gangsta, they can't make a radio edit
This that act correct, cause I ain't got to pack a Tec
I could just snap my hand and have a nigga snap ya neck
This the talk is cheap, so I let the luger speak
Pump the torch, then dump the corpse off in Dawson's Creek
The O.G. killer is back
So if you're living is whack
Come see me, little nigga, I'll give you a gat like
Here, here's a hammer nigga
Here, go hurt a nigga
Here, go jam a nigga
Here, go murk a nigga",5

"You go to my head
And you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne

You go to my head
Like a sip of sparkling burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought
That you might give a thought to my plea, cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be?

You go to my head
With a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes

Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head",5
"[Scratching]

Behold the fungus among us
When dabblin with babblin
I sends the battle scene to the apocalypse
With this you grab my cock ya lips 
Be gettin sorta puckery
Gettin the Brewin gassed to save that ass come stop the fuckery
My style'll leave ya posin like a hitch hiker
Make me want to bitch microphone slap that shady ass, you bullshit nigga
Your frontin said you didn't think too hot of me
But once you feel the vocal sodomy you'll say, ""You got it, G""
I finds the virgin ears I'm bustin raw pops
Ya savin the drops, tryin to analyze my DNA, the verbal blueprint
Even if you spend eternity you're baffled, nigga
Havin not the slightest clue of how I'm swingin
Bringin styles and flow that's nastier than urine
See my shit is pure and ghetto embellished demonic funk and all that good shit
A bad nigga when it comes to grabbin mics
I love all women of the spectrum, fuck around I'm stabbin dykes
And as I hurt em I convert em, when it comes to honey dip skits 
I'm leavin pussies sore as if you just delivered triplets, I flip shit 
When niggas say the brewin doesn't rhyme slick 
I yokes em in the Heimlich just to get the fuckin garbage out ya throat 
Mentally hardcore 
There be no guard for defendin against the shit I'm sendin 
Once you're comprehendin the ill funk aphrodisiac 
Givin the hoodies woodies as I'm fuckin up the head like brass knuckles givin noogies

I be's the hell fire word reaver 
Even Ripley can't believe 
I pull a stunt as if my name was Colt Seaver 
AKA The Fall Guy
I never score, why?
I'm hittin like Mattingly
Get your fuckin Webster's dictionary 
Look under ""fat"" and you'll see my profile so smile 
You're grinnin like the Joker
Cause I chose to smoke a mic and let you witness 
Get this through your thick skull: my shit is deadly 
I kicks my verse, niggas couldn't offer competition with a medley of their works
I smirks when booty niggas try and grab this 
Survival of the fittest call me fuckin Tony Atlas, at the podium 
I pours my sodium in open flesh wounds as I mesh tunes with the vocal joint 
To become the focal point
Brothas of funk soon discover I be +deeper+ than that nigga Larry Fishburne's +cover+
Hover on the L, sorta like a stealth in the night
Then I makes the party +jump+ even when it's full of +white men+

Check it out
I represent enlightenment 
That have you squintin 
Hintin to rewards of the lord's charity received with clarity 
I heave skillaful syllable is the brick I stick in music mortar 
Makin ya think and raisin my floor to architect

I comes to spark a teck
Mind barrages massages carressed in peace 
The vocal acupuncture your stress released 
Like a hymen crack in my rhymin slack and never that

What y'all know about them wild niggas
Devil child niggas
Have-you-kick-the-bucket-say-fuck-it-and-smile-niggas
The type to catch the Buddha buzz, slide up to the fuzz
Sayin ""Officer, run your shotty before I catch this body""
I knew this nigga Smokey, sorta like his pistol
Barrel when you're in peril and shit like that was wanted
But later that would die down,
Sorta like many abandoned that he ran with
His block felt sorta haunted
His only solitude was wifey, word to life, G it seemed
They was together forever and now the womb had been seeded
He needed a job and the robbin wouldn't do it
He wasn't tryin to go out like Diquan in Strapped
Her mother was a nurse, her purse was chubby
From the hospital she found Smokey some work and shit was lovely
With some cream in here, feed a patient there, he had loot
And not a nigga on the street would have to get that pocket tapped
He's workin in maternity and learnin
Seein much about the infant children
To be skilled in fatherhood
Stealin baby stuff home for self
And he didn't have to pull the Mac-20 off the shelf and get...

Chorus:
Loose if a brotha can't take no more
Loose if a brotha can't swing it
Loose if a brotha can't break once more
Loose if a brotha.....

[Brewin]
In Maternity, Smokey saw stuff, raw stuff,
Make-you-drop-your-jaw-stuff, hospitals get sorta wild
He saw some babies shakin, awakin if they were fortunate
His soul was scorchin, it would have thinkin of his child
Later there would be no ""Honey, I'm home,""
Strictly ""Woman if you jeopardize my seed, dead up, I leave you wet up""
On the block, a flock of zombies entranced
By the peddlers of temporary ghetto heaven had him fed up
His job was gettin hard to fuck with
They had even had him stuck with the disposal of the stillborn
Poisoned by the nourishment, the ill torn soul from flesh
From the womb to tomb
Seein shit like that'll have you crazy
That night he had a dream
And it was a child nursin upon the semen of the glass genetalia
Clouded nut after clouded nut
He woke and shouted ""What the FUCK is goin on?""
Smokey was swayze, it's time to get....

Chorus

[Brewin]
He figured there was only one way
As he rushed the runway lookin wild deranged
This was common, without any qualm inside he was tookin
Lookin at fiends of the pebble adored praised,
Devil for lord raised from the crystallized tombs
Through fumes from the floor
Blazed the sole sacrificial altar
He chose now to halt the worship dealin that ultimate headrush... 

The lead crushed, buyer or seller decoratin hell a flame
With the choir of the firearms to blame
In the mornin by the time the smoke cleared,
Everybody seen the massacre, the local folk cheered
""Oh, thank the Lord Almighty,"" the pharmacy was out of business
On the L a chubby widow cries alone because her man had gotten...

"I declare war 
The joy becomes a rappifyin' weapon 
If you step in 
When your draws get mobbed behind enemy lines
You become a sittin' duck but fuck 
I ain't givin' 'em livin' trifle 
The pen and pad becomes a 12 gauge rifle 
This is no laughing matter 
Step into this you step in a minefield 
Your body's scattered 
You people drop pickin' up the pieces 
But only corny niggas 
The attack from a brotha like the Buddy never ceases 
Without a moment of silence the violence thickens
So if you ain't got it together you slim pickings 
Shorts and prisoners are never taken 
If you fakin' all the booty competition 
I'm a bag fuck a white flag 
Get down and dirty like a brotha in the trench 
Leave a nigga dead and stinkin' as he wonders what his stench is 
I'm bustin' clip after clip 
My artillery will funk on the punk 
When ya want to test my shit

Tell it to hell is it
I feel my brain swell like meningitis 
With the slightest mind motion 
Givin' me the notion
That I got it bad 
I think I got a brain tumor 
Brain rumor 
Such a pain to analyze the strain and then understand it
The seed was planted
That shit is ill but still 
The thought I'm lovin' got the dome growin' 
With the biscuit in the oven 
Shovin' nothin' but the nutrients 
My diet to support me
A whiff of the spliff 
A guzzle of the forty to inspire fire thought
To the mic there was marriage
Causin' competition 
Verbal miscarriage of the mental fetus 
Greet us with the rugged rhythm then I'm showin'
I think I feel my water breakin' thus I'm flowin'
Timin' my contractions 
Concentratin' on my breathin'
Heavin' curses at the father he has the funk 
'Cause if I flunk my shit ain't livin'
Pushin' givin' every bit of what I'm worth 
And as the Brewin' drops the lyrical 
The miracle of birth

I be the sick ass brotha, nasty ass nigga 
A phony motherfucker grave digga 
I know this sounds rough 
But I had enough to funk 
So part of me the heart of me
So if you corny nigga 
It's like cloggin' up my artery 
You cuttin' circulation 
So now it's do or die 
While niggas always try to test my shit
Only preservation of the funk is why I kick this
As I give a simple diagnosis of the sickness

Now upon the fruits of my labor 
Your ear feasts 
The beast from within 
It's some shit ain't it
The picture painted 
From the use of a noun and a verb might disturb 
We make you say, ""Damn that nigga's crazy"" 
Well if we crazed, deranged well then we fittin'
If you say the world's a normal place
Who the fuck you kiddin'?
Your mind's blind if you say you haven't seen this
As I walk the fine line between insanity and genius",4
"I saw the splendor of the moonlight
On Honolulu Bay
There's something tender in the moonlight
On Honolulu Bay

And all the beaches are filled with peaches
Who bring their ukes along
And in the glimmer of the moonlight
They love to sing this song

If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you
If you like to linger where it's shady
Ukulele Lady linger too

If you kiss Ukulele Lady
While you promise ever to be true
And she sees another Ukulele
Lady foolin' 'round with you

Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)
Maybe she'll find somebody else
By and by

To sing to when it's cool and shady
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo
If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you

She used to sing to me by moonlight
On Honolulu Bay
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight
Although I'm far away

Some day I'm going, where eyes are glowing
And lips are made to kiss
To see somebody in the moonlight
And hear the song I miss

If you like Ukulele Lady
Ukulele Lady like a'you
If you like to linger where it's shady
Ukulele Lady linger too

If you kiss Ukulele Lady
While you promise ever to be true
And she sees another Ukulele
Lady foolin' 'round with you.

Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)

Tu hi tu hai meri jaan

Lately things don't seem
The way they used to be 
Between you and me
Girl I'm missing you

You say I'm never home
Chasing my own goals
And you just don't know
That it's all for you

Don't you understand
I'm trying to be a better man
And all I do, I do for you
Baby heart in hand, I'll give you everything I can
Girl if you can only see

But I never want to lose what I got
I wouldn't trade it for anything dear to my heart, oh no

You take the good times with the bad
How else would you know happy from sad

You're gonna have to finally look back

And you'll look back and see
What happened in between
And you'll appreciate
Each and every single day

And the cling of the glasses
We toast to the future
And we drink to the past

But nevertheless
These are the best days (of our lives)

Sometimes the weather can be rain
But one day it will be sunny again
Without the clouds of life
It's just another sunny day

These are the times
That I will never forget
These are the best days (of our lives)

Sweepin' the clouds away 
On my way to where the air is sweet

How to get to Sesame Street? 

Come and play

Friendly neighbors there 
That's where we meet 

Can you tell me how to get

Every door will open wide 
To happy people like you
Happy people like

"Wake up in the morning with a head like 'What ya done?'
This used to be the life but I don't need another one
Good luck cuttin' nothin', carryin' on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up gettin' down?

So I play along when I hear that favorite song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You better know when you're swingin' 'round the room
Looks like magic's solely yours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with the one in bed till dawn with you, you, you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colors make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clapped your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that you'll be fine

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one if I can't get down with you, you, you

You can't make me dance around
But your two-step makes my chest pound
Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer light

But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way
You think that I could muster up a little soft shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you break it down when I'm not in the mood?

It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort in a heart that's going back home

who'll do anything for you

Laying out another lie,
thinking 'bout a life of crime
That's what I'll have to do
to keep me away from you

Honey, you know it makes you mad
Why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
Baby, I know it makes you sad
But when they're handing out the heartaches
you know you got to have you some

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers
and tell 'em they're the only one
And others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for fun

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts,
knowing it ain't really smart
The joker ain't the only fool
who'll do anything for you

Playing with the queen of hearts",5
"Once I had a heart cold as ice
Love to me was only for fun
I'd make a mark for each broken heart
Like notches on the butt of a gun

Once I had a trick up my sleeve
And a reputation all over town
I was heartless and cold wherever I'd go
I shot down every young boy I found

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit
I used to be a heartbreak kid
Then I met you and the next thing I knew
There I was oh shot full of love

Well who'd have thought that someone like you
Could take a desperado like me
But oh here I am I'm as meek as a lamb
With my bleeding heart there at your feet

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit

Yes I used to be a moonlight bandit",5
"I live my life walking down the street
Meet the faces of the people I see

All the time I see your reflection

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down
Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Here I am waiting like a fool I've always been
Hopin' maybe someday you will change
The same old lies you tell me are the same old lies you live
I know what you're doin' and I know where you're sleepin' at night

I don't want your cheap love
I don't want you comin' around
Don't you know that you're cheap love
Someday it's gonna tear you down

I don't want your cheap love

Listen, boy, didn't I show you how to love?
Whoa oh, what were you thinking of?

That's the easy way out

How am I doin'? Well, I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now but it seems now it was only yesterday
It ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
What if I remember that's the same thing that you told me it was lonely yes
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

I gotta go now 
I guess I'll see you somewhere around
You don't know, you'll never know, we don't know, you can't know when 
I'll be back in town
Maybe tomorrow, please remember
What I told you, told you, that entire time you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time slips away

Oh, what I want you to do is just remember, just remember, what I told you
And time, time, you're gonna pay
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slips away

Just remember, remember, what I told you
And time, time
It ain't funny, funny, funny how time just slipped away

It's the same thing, same thing, that you told me

And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have
Loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer
(spent my life running 'round)
And it's so hard to change
(Can't seem to settle down)
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out
And turning out the same

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

You can spend all your time making money

You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
Would you still be mine?

And when you're looking for your freedom
(Nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door
(Can't find it anywhere)
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back, you're running back
For more

So put me on a highway
And show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time

Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time",6

Is loving you

And I have never been afraid of losing
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

Now, you and I, we're not children
We have both been loved before
We have given and we have taken
Many rides on troubled shores

And all the heartaches and temptations
Only make me love you more
The sweetest thing I've ever known
Is loving you

And I have never been afraid of losing
And I have never wanted love to be a chain
I only know that when I'm with you
You're my sunshine, you're my rain

Take another hit now I'm in my zone
I can't remember shit these drugs got me gone

Let's get high, let's get stoned
Take a hit of this and you won't make it home

"When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead

Hey baby let's fly away to a private place
So far away we get high and feel like we out of space
She keep looking back at it, we be grinding like jack rabbits
All she want is this pipe, I turn her into a crack addict
Ain't nothing that a nigga can't afford
Louis, Gucci or Chanel, I'll buy the store
You and me on a nude beach, sippin' champagne
Making love on a island resort
No need to pack luggage, hope on the jet like ""fuck it""
I got everything you want and you need, I guarantee you'll love it
She the baddest woman you ever seen, she belong with King Magazine
You might seen her on a movie screen, she's so dope now I'm her fiend
Just thinking about her I don't need a buzz
We party hard, we don't need a club
Bring your passport we're making love in Persia on a Persian rug

When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead

I got a Rolls-Royce baby that's yours
I got a private jet baby that's yours
I'm balling baby, what's mine is yours
You can have all that and even more
I got a black card, go on a shopping spree
I buy you so much ice, girl you can ski
Your old man tryna lock you down
Come with Juicy J and you'll be free
She got her own, she independent
We at the lake, she skinny dipping
In the hotel we wake the neighbors
They knocking like Jehovah's Witness
Girl we can kick, ever tried karate?
Out on my yacht we go island shopping
Back to my suite, ten grand a night
Just me and you, it's a private party
She's sent from heaven, mayne
She needs wings on her
I might have to put a ring on her
Damn she so bad, damn she so thick
I wonder how she fit jeans on it
For me she unleash her inner animal when we meet
And she a lady off in the streets
But a beast when we in the sheets

When we go walking in the woods
Nobody can hear us
And you could be as freaky as you should
I love you at your weirdest
Unleash the animal, hear my mating call
I want you to be fearless
When we go walking in the woods
A natural experience
Go ahead",6
"Six AM, Las Vegas
In a suite, yeah, I got bitches on the way

You ain't putting nothing on nothing, my nigga, so you should just shut the fuck up
You ain't been rolling nothing, I'm trying to stuff seven grams up in my blunt
My Backwood like a back, gotta roll it off a flat
She started off on her knees, she gonna end up on her back
She mixing the Xan with the Purp'
Noddin' off, look like she breaking her neck
I gotta treat that ass like a lateral, she steady throwing it back
Mixing the Kush with the Purp', that's how you smoke when you rich
I drop a bean in the lean, that's how you get high as shit
Mixing the dark with the white and bubbly, we gon' just call it a twist
I'ma just pass that lil' bitch to my bro, we gonna call that an assist

Mix the weed with the drank and let's have a good night
Mix the Xan' with Codeine and she about to take flight

(You know Khalifa man don't sleep)
I like to party all night
Fuck a bitch, black or she white
Older bitch might be from Canada
Give me her cheese like a manager
Her nigga a lame, he can't handle her
She gave me brain on the camera
Smoke weed but got stamina
Gin turn me into an animal
Don't Snapchat me that pussy, I want it for real
She claim that she ain't fucking, but she know the deal
Got bars like a jail
Got pounds on a scale
Fuck a broad and don't tell
She only get Taco Bell
Niggas buying they own coffin, they just need the nail
I turn on the TV and watch the KK sail
Wake up in the morning and roll me some joints, put them all in the air
Just pour me up some drinks I'm about to

Mix the weed with the drank and let's have a good night
Mix the Xan' with Codeine and she about to take flight
And she on ecstasy, so she fucking all night
All night, yeah, she fucking all night
Mix the weed with the drank and let's have a good night
Mix the Xan' with Codeine and she about to take flight
And she on ecstasy so she fucking all night
All night, yeah, she fucking all night

You got that Xan' and lean, she gon' fuck you on sight
When she wake up from her, I'ma give her all pipe
And that pussy ain't that good, that shit was just alright
Had to call my homie and tell him that it just all hype
And that bitches gave me dome and it took all night
And that sloppy ain't toppy, she didn't hold the balls right
She just wanna do drugs and smoke my weed up all night
So I kicked that bitch out and told her, bust a hard right
See, she a cutie with a booty but she don't know what she doin'
So I had to stop her, tell that bitch to keep it movin'
Money right in front of her, but she don't know what she viewin'
Put a milli' in her mouth but she don't know what she chewin'

Mix the weed with the drank and let's have a good night
Mix the Xan' with Codeine and she about to take flight
And she on ecstasy, so she fucking all night
All night, yeah, she fucking all night
Mix the weed with the drank and let's have a good night
Mix the Xan' with Codeine and she about to take flight
And she on ecstasy so she fucking all night
All night, yeah, she fucking all night",5

Cobra-snake for a necktie.

Tell me who do you love?

Tombstone head and a graveyard mind,

Who do you love?

Down the alley the ice wagon flew. 
Hit a bump, somebody screamed, 
Should'a heard just what I seen.

Do you love her, yeah 
Do you love me, babe? 
Do you love it, yeah

Well, who, baby, who do you love?

"There's a dead man hanging, slumped over the steering wheel of an interstate
Runaway bursting into flames
And the devil was gently breathing, sleeping face-down in my
Apartment, and like all his friends I'm growing tired of his games...

And there's a homeless man arranging his hands, grooving to the beat
Radiating from a police scanner, who said ""The air was feeling good to
Me, just as cool and ripe as air can be,"" and a woman who sincerely
Believes in UFOs and who can blame her when the stars are hanging
Overhead, dangling by a thread, floating ten thousand feet off the ground...

(This was a story told to me when I was just the age of 17, one which
God himself dictated to me, he said, ""This is how all this shits gonna
Be when I blow your little planet into smithereens."" It haunted my
Dreams like an accident on reply on a TV screen.)

She sees faces in her dreams--strange machines she'd never seen
Blueprints of submarines to reassemble in a time of dire need
And there were preachers in the desert, waving to the crowd
Dictating seven angry letters from a man up in the clouds

And there were 27 soldiers telling 27 lies
And a hole inside a hurricane with a pair of beady eyes
A pair of beady eyes looking down onto the pavement while the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all will want a front seat when shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova turned the other way around!

There were strangers in the subway and men in limousines making deals and
Swapping photographs of cans of gasoline, and there are no angels in the woodwork
Or devils on the ground, and they are looking through a hurricane's tectonic wall of
Sound and a man who smokes his cigarettes the other way around and she is looking
In behind him from inside a wall of sound and she is dancing with the neon because
The air is feeling good against her arms and legs and fingertips are measuring the
Distance in the spaces in between me and you and all your friends when there's no
Time to load a weapon and no time to make amends and people frozen in their tracks
Staring at the sky at a hole inside a hurricane revealing...

A pair of beady eyes!
A pair of beady eyes looking down onto the pavement while the stars are gathered 'round
Because they all will want a front seat when shit starts going down
Because the sun is just a supernova turned the other way around!

This is not a test, this is the real thing...
This is not a test, this is the real thing...

To invite everyone I've known
Dead and alive
To a street where we can be
Finally free

Well, they would come in droves
Wearing their hearts on their sleeves, oh no
How good it felt to have them worn
Just like they should

And everybody here wants to know
Did everybody say what a good day that it was
For everybody here who said what a good day it was?

Did they smile 'cause they like it, 
Did they smile 'cause they like it, 
Did they? Whoa

Running circles around ourselves
Just for fun
And oh, how good it felt
To be young and loved
And feel it in our bones

And everybody here wants to know
Did everybody say what a good day that it was
For everybody here who said what a good day it was?

That it felt like this, we were never told
That it felt like this we were never told
And it scares us bad so we'll have to be bold
But there's still one thing that we need to know.

For everybody here who said what a good day it was?

But she can't recall his face
She hears knocking on her door at night
But he never leaves a trace

Repeated again and again in her dreams:

End of the hall, it's just the stars stooping down to sing their goodbyes while a
Man with a briefcase and hollowed out eyes spoke...

Beware, be wary
Of secrets that you may keep
Cause if they're any indication of what sorrow brings you
Then don't take your demons to sleep

Such a funny girl but oh, so blue
What are you supposed to do
When I can't be there with you?

I'm the man in the moon

And why on earth would you?

Water, leads to water
Water leads to rivers leads to oceans leads to you

That you don't even know what that means.

Can't even be half of the real thing

But then I see your face in the crowd, I think
How could I be starting over?
Cause when you meet someone new
It all just takes over you
And you think that you never really tried
Open your heart
Open your mind.

Give me a chance, it's worth taking

Gimme a chance, it's worth taking, oh

And we always say the same old things,
And we always use the same tired lines
Stayin up all night, talkin it out
Endin up with noone on our side

And as time goes on and on, I can feel my heart growing colder and colder,
But then I see your face in the crowd, I think
How could I be starting over?

It's strange how you can never know who's
Going to stay with you and who will leave
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?

We walk through the park at night
Gazing up at all the satellites
(Lights) in the city made it hard to see
Do you remember me?
Do you remember me?

On that night, long ago
Walking down the road that we used to know
You said, ""Let's take it slow""
Let's take the long way home
Let's take the long way home

One day further down the road
With full grown children of your own
If I passed by you on a busy street,
Will you remember me?
Will you remember me?

On that night, long ago
Walking down the road that we used to know
You said, ""Let's take it slow""
Let's take the long way home
Let's take the long way home

One day down the road you'll find
Everything you hid inside
Caught beneath the ocean,
Searching for a sign of life

One day down the road you'll find
Something that you kept inside
Caught beneath the ocean
A part of us is still alive

One day down the road you'll find
Everything you hid inside

On that night, long ago
Walking down the road that we used to know
You said, ""Let's take it slow""

"Maybe the sky isn't falling,
Maybe it's all in my head.
Maybe the world isn't dangling off the edge.

But the feelings the same,
In fact it feels like a trap,
Set by someone who wants for my heart to collapse.

So can we take a moment and stop?

'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, who falls for you

Maybe the world isn't ending,
Maybe its been postponed.
I've got a feeling it's happening all on its own.

They say that love is contagious,
But I don't know about that.
'Cause broken hearts are the easiest part to give back.

So can we take a moment and stop?

'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, who falls for you

'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one
'Cause I don't want to be the one, be the one

The timer's up,
And I've got nowhere to go.
Take my pride,
Take my friends,
Just don't take my heart.

I don't think I can take it,
Another heartbreaking,
Another whole world crumbling in two.
I'm sick of the endings,
And I'm sick of beginnings,
Of anyone who stumbles into view.

Towards the long wooden pier that hangs over the beach
She took off her dress
And she walked towards the sea
And thought maybe it could sweep away me

His engine turned off with the keys
As he ran towards her, he fell to his knees
He said what have I done wrong
He said what did I forget
She looked away and she wept

He said why don't you show me where it hurts
Why don't you show me where it hurts
He said why don't you show me where it hurts
Where it hurts the most

She said it follows me wherever I go
I wake up each morning and the darkness unfolds
Yeah I just cant fake it
Everything's like a choir
And I cant live like this anymore

He said why don't you show me where it hurts
He said why don't you show me where it hurts
He said why don't you show me where it hurts
Where it hurts the most

I guess it'd be easier just to keep it all buried beneath

And then we walked among the pines

It makes you heal
It makes you whole when it goes

If it goes ...
If it goes ...
If it goes ...
If it goes ...
If it goes ...

Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Lose their taste for kissing?

"From the south side of Chicago
On Woodland Avenue
The youngest of eight children
With a voice that soared and soothed
Singing at the Lincoln Center
The church a block away
Like a perfect angel
As the Red Sanders Band played

She said, ""Baby
Can we just go some place warm
And stay there ?til the baby's born?
I'll be your roadside angel
And walk with you through life""

She was his roadside angel
He was her guiding light
They drove south from New York city
To Gainesville, Florida
And settled for two summers
There with Marc and Maya

He loved her from the moment he saw her
At the top of the electric theatre stairs
Wrapped in his loving arms she lay
Listening to Stevie she flew away
She flew away

Stretching over mountains
Across the sea

Through the barren plains

Binds me to you
An electrical undetectable current
Charging over mountains
Across the sea

Under deserts
Through the barren planes

No matter where you are
No matter no matter how far

My rose tinted glasses are incredible
Blinding me to the inevitable
Coloring my judgment like a jumbo pack of pens
Like the ones you buy for birthday's
For children of your friends

My inner guide was screaming look out beware
I silenced Miss Righteous with one stony glare
Figuring what would she know anyway
Yet thanks to her I'm standing her
Defiantly today

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

My white flag was flying in the wind
Though you had no heard for surrendering
On we marched regardless for reason's still unknown
Sometimes the wrong thing
Seems so much better than being alone

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

Is this a good time to mention
Some where contemplating
An earthly intervention
We're all blessed with 20/20 hindsight
You're just another thing
I didn't quite get it right

I was clearly guilty
Of only being able to see
The good you did for me

My Jacob's ladder in the sky
Has all the fallen angels climbing down

Cross my heart and hope to live
Number one on my wish list
If the angels get here they'll come round

To stop me pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
I would give the shirt off my back
I'd gladly make a deal
With any of the angels to change how I feel

I would hand over my soul
I'd relinquish all control
To any of the angels climbing down

Not fourteen more years of this
Stranded in the wilderness
If the angels get here send them round

To stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
I would give the shirt off my back
I'd gladly make a deal
With any of the angels to change how I feel

It's not like I've stolen someone else's blessing
Love's still blind and maybe that's the lesson

Stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
Stop me from pushing this ice block up hill
From running flat out to stand still
I would give the shirt off my back
I'd gladly make a deal
With any of the angels to change how I feel

I would give the shirt of my back to any of the angels

Thanks for being soft and kind
For making me change my mind
About everyone and everything
Boxed in this corner of mine
You walked across my borderline
And reached the girl that used to be me

When I was brave
Fearless, alive and unsaved
When I was free
Of all these black lined boundaries

Avoiding any fire and smoke
Safety first is all she wrote
Barricading up the open doors
Headed for the comfort zone
And settled for a life alone
Looking back locked in the ivory tower

To when I'd jump in
Not wondering if I would sink or swim
When I would dare
To move an inch without a single care

Before I invented
Perfect me
Perfect me
Perfect me

Thanks for being sweet and strong
For making me feel I belong
To the land of the living

Like when I was brave
Fearless, alive and unsaved
When I was free
Of all these black lined boundaries

Before I invented
Perfect me
Perfect me
Perfect me

This plane is taking off

I have brought you this gold crown
I spliced its flowers together

at the turning point
This comes from a faithful hand",7
"A rock there is where, as they say, the ocean dew distills
And from its beetling brow, there pours a copious stream for pitchers to be dipped therein
'T was here I had a friend washing robes of purple in the trickling stream
And she was laying them out to dry on the face of a warm and sunny rock
From her I heard the tidings
See, here the wretched sufferer comes
His youthful flesh and golden hair have lost their beauty
Oh, what pain
What double grief has fallen on these halls and swooped on them from heaven",5

There are so many days of rain
In Mexico City
A good reason to go
You know I love to run away from sun

Is it time to dance?
I'll fall you know I like to fall

The rush hour car
Stares and
The memory of your piano

Can I feel you? Are you
Mythological?

Figures pass so quickly
That I realize my
Eyes know very well
It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for
In my raincoat

The time change worked well
I had a good excuse for being late
But I pushed open the door
The room was empty all the people gone

When the cab pulled up
I laughed, I forgot where I was going
There I stood mystified
I could give no reason for my frozen stare

Am I heading toward you?
It's a hot day
Can I feel you? Are you
Mythological?

Figures pass so quickly
That I realize my
Eyes know very well
It's impossible to see
Who I'm waiting for

In this parking lot
Thousands of people pass through
On the festival day
Playing their saxophones
I see a flashing light
I'm blinded by the possibility",6

I go nowhere twenty times

Oh, every time I do put on boots
I feel the charge like I've a good thing to run to
But I only hear the rattlesnake winds
They blow dust and I'm helpless to fight back

Can you bring me
A fresher perspective please?
Should I be a prouder conqueror
Just bathing in the light?

Oh true it's brighter than
Sky we left years ago
I'll take a photograph and pass it by my eyes
Everytime
I decamp so wearily

Oh, every time I do put on boots
I feel the charge like I've a good thing to run to
But I only hear the rattlesnake winds
They blow dust and I'm helpless to fight back",6

Through your mystery eyes?

You'll see lightning cascading
Pronouncements of our love

It's a holiday
They tell me

How long
Have you lived here?
Have you seen
The river?

Do you know the proper way
To ask for a cigarette?

I'm asking before winter comes

Stay here with me 'til morning
With the three-man orchestra playing
I ask a fortune teller
What they whisper when
I walk by

Do you know the proper way
To ask for a cigarette?
I'm asking before winter comes

I wait for you to see me

Wearing your favorite thing

I awoke pleasing you so slowly
I'm giving you time
The soft light
On your man brow
I'm asking you to show me how

Show me now
Show me a second face
Show me how you make
Your second face

Fingers situate themselves in dark,
Moving the way that is so easy
And in summer bright your shout
On the surface, warm

I throw a box full of oranges,
Syrup seeping out
Searching for a season smell
I run from you then walk back to you
Who I don't know
Sniffing for a light

Show me now
Show me a second face
Show me how you make
Your second face

What did I do to make you feel so bad?
What did I do that you would make me feel so bad?",5
"Tonight the birds are watching me
Do they have more important things to do?
What of hearts in diamonds?
Oh I don't understand
I don't understand

Into Maxim's we will see them walk
Will they eat a piece of cheese or will they talk?
When they're loud enough we can hear their words
By night we are inquisitory birds
Some nights we are asked if we ever tire
Of gazing at their heels and everyday desires
Remember every dewy tale written of their loves?
Compare them to the ones they touch in front of us

We do not dance a story for you
Gil Blas bored whispers awakening the beast in me
Go!
Find your feet
Drink some blood
Say it to my face
If you want to be starting something
If you want to be starting something",5

Faces I see

The stately, the rugged
Under dirt
And sun umbrellas
Their eyes on the gun

Some fierce lady eyes
Some warm gentleman eyes

Look into mine

They call me
No one knows the story
I hate an imperious glance
In the gold country

I'm writing her a love song
How we fall into a dream in the rocks
Our rocks
They found me there
Chased after me
I crawled away quickly
Wasn't sure if i was lost or if I was running away again
Up what you now call the fourteen
I was a runner up the fourteen
Their mouths move
Say they wanna be the good guys
They wanna be triumphant

They put me to sleep
On diagonal rocks
So no one knows the story
I hate an imperious glance
In the gold country
In the gold

No one knows the story
Of ""Bandido""
In the gold country
""Bandido""
No one knows the story
I hate an imperious glance

In this late hour
Maybe trouble
Maybe fantasy
It's too hot for winter
Patience, violent heart

Bright blue flames under my fingers
I'm taken by surprise
Taken through the city
Storm on my back

It is the hand of love so rough
What we're feeling for the first time?
Does Claire love too, or Julie? Do they love?
When Lis feels the way I do
Can I feel her percuss through the city?

Through the city
All the phones are ringing 
with the restaurant's complaint
Even the regular customers have left early tonight
Walked out without a hat
Everyone has left early without a hat
A fire without a hat

With new softer songs to sing
All the birds of the world make their way over
With new softer songs to sing

The moon is true
Maxim's on fire
Gigi swimming
Oh, I see my love swimming
Moon, you know disaster from a warm bath

All who are muffled by the squall
Doesn't love scare them?
Screamers on the balconies
Trombones on the roofs
The screamers who fell in love or died

Looking for what I remember
My name I know
I love going to the movies

I turn and see my childhood home
On this new beach where strange bird fly
These birds swoop right over
Looking out for me

""Where does she come from?""
The birds sang so loud

""Oh she's been marooned, oh
Can anybody help her?""

""Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?"" (oh)

""Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?""

The sun comes up
Slower than I remember
A man I know
He lights his cigarette with nothing
Not a smile or memory
His shadow still wet as my gash against the the rock
Sharp and high on the Balearic promontory
I see his ship go
What stings me?
These birds can't stop the waves

""Oh she's been marooned, oh
Can anybody help her?"" (oh)

""Oh she's been marooned (oh)
Can anybody help her?"" (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

""He covered me in cactus""
The birds can sing a song
""I don't remember much but""
The birds can sing a song
""He turned me around""
The birds can sing a song
""My mouth quivered""
The birds can sing a song
""It's 4 am""
The birds can sing a song
""The man is gone""
The birds can sing a song
""The man is gone""
The birds can sing a song
""Good riddance, he is gone""

""Blood is on his billhook""
""His billhook caught my neck""

""How unnaturally I gaze""
""I gaze at nothing""

I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear
I can't swim, it's lucidity, so clear

The one with whom I've seen
All hour's moons
Once the curtains lifted
And he said ""I will swim to you""

Language is such a play 
He called his exit, but his eyes are irresolute
What pasts still sit today?
I feel I'm walking around in blue

He can hear me sing
He can hear me sing
Though he is far
I'll never lose sight of him

He turned to me then looked away
A silhouette
A silhouette
Still returns to me

I'll hand him his coat
It's exactly where he left it long ago
We'll fall all over floorboards
I lose my breath just envisioning the scene
Mysteries that wake up late, the table's set
And the painting of his face
No time to hesitate
I cede all my love and play your abandoned fool

Though he is far
I'll never lose 

He turned to me 
He turned to me and looked away

A silhouette
A silhouette returns to me
A silhouette

A silhouette
A silhouette returns to me
A silhouette

A silhouette returns to me",5
"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",5

"For the love of a woman a man unlocks his heart
And reveals all the secrets it holds
And the love of a woman will find his better part
When he gives her the key to his soul


He will listen to her dreams
He will ask her what she needs
He will help her build the life she wants to live
He will hold her when she cries
With a love that never dies
All these things he will give
For the love of a woman

For the love of a woman a man will sacrifice
While he waits for a moment of grace
With the love of a woman a man will pay the price
For the trust that he sees in her face
He will open any door
Leave the life he knew before
To convince her that he's all she'll ever need
And when he's afraid to start
He will step into the dark
'Cause he knows she'll give his eyes the power to see
With the love of a woman

And her promises to help her dreams come true
No there's nothing in this world that he won't do

Though he's not a work of art
He will try with all his heart
To become the man she knows that he can be
With the love of a woman
The love of a woman
He will give his life
For the love of a woman",7

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",6

Once again I hold you tight
Tho' you're gone your love lives on when moonlight beams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
And as long as my heart will beat
Sweet lover, we'll always meet
Here in my deep purple dreams
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo, 
Wo-o-oo-wo-wo",6
"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Lullaby of Birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet and we'll go
Flyin' high in Birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love",6
"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",6
"Moonlight and magnolia, starlight in your hair
All the world a dream come true
Did it really happen, was I really there, was I really there with you?
 
We lived our little drama, we kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I can't forget the glamor, your eyes held a tender light
And stars fell on Alabama last night
I never planned in my imagination a situation so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center just you and me, dear
My heart beat like a hammer, my arms wound around you tight
And stars fell on Alabama last night

"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",7
"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

I will be there
And everywhere
Here, there and everywhere",8
"In A Sentimental Mood 
I can see the stars come thru my room
While your loving attitude
Is like a flame that lights the gloom
On the wings of ev'ry kiss 
Drift a melody so strange and sweet
In this sentimental bliss you make my 
Paradise complete
Rose pearls seem to fall
It's all like a dream to call you mine
My heart's lighter thing 
Since you made me this night a thing divine
In A Sentimental Mood 
I'm within a world so heavenly
For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me
In A Sentimental Mood

On the wings of ev'ry kiss

For I never dreamt 
That you'd be loving sentimental me",5
"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",7
"Once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of Oz
And a wickeder, wickeder, wickeder witch there never, never was
She filled the folks in Munchkin land with terror and with dread
'Till one fine day from Kansas way a cyclone caught a house 
That brought the wicked, wicked witch her doom 
As she was flying on her broom
For the house fell on her head and the coroner pronounced her dead
And thru the town the joyous news was spread
 
Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
She's gone where the goblins go below, below, below, yo ho
Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out
Ding-dong! the merry-o sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead
 
Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!

"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

Why don't we let her know
She's got this kind of hope
Why don't we let her know

Laying naked on the pine floor
Lonely we dance around the dying
Maybe she got what she came for
Lying naked on the pine floor 
Lonely we dance around the dying
Maybe she got what she came for

When I'm all alone. 
I can feel your heartbeat like it's my own.

I can hear your music from a million miles away,
The angels got right when they made you they way they made you.
Sometimes I wonder if you're made from bones and skin 
Or are you something for me to begin again, again. 

This love, this love 
This love, this love.

I will build you a mountain,
So you can see
All the away across the universe
To me.

I will build you shelter for when the days are cold .
I will be your shelter for when were old and kind

This love, this love,
This love, this love, 
This love, this love

"He's a dog
But he's dressed up like a sheep
Got bones all through the backyard
But he likes to drink tea

We play scrabble on the weekend
And he talks about the weather most of the time
I thought my sacred body with him
It would be fine

And I walked into the doorway
He slid across the room
My heart, it started racing
I just didn't know what to do

And he laid me on the floor
And my screams they go unheard
The lady living next door
Well, she's 6 feet under the dirt

Daddy, why don't you protect me?
Someone's gonna hurt me, there's nothing I can do
Daddy, why don't you protect me?
Someone's gonna hurt me, there's nothing I can do

But he's dressed up like a sheep
He's got bones all through the backyard
But he likes to fool me

And I travel through the doorway
I thought I'd be fine
But it's not the way it's gonna go
This time

It won't end here, your faith has got to be greater than your fear

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry

While it hears you, trapped in another dimension

Drop your guard, you don't have to be smart all of the time
I've got a mind full of blanks, I need to go somewhere new fast
And don't be shy, oh no, at least deliberately
'Cause no one really cares or wonders why anymore
Oh, I got music, coming out of my hands and feet and kisses

That is how it once was done
All the dreamers on the run

Forgive them, even if they are not sorry
All the vultures, bootleggers at the door waiting

Complicated mammals on the wings of robots

But so close to being despised
It's more important to be nice

I take you dancing too
I take you out
All the thing you wanna do

And I'll give you space

Don't you know that
If a time won't
Pause or burn
I'll stay right in my place
Now worry's over!

I hear it in your silence,
When you don't speak
There is a quiet, cryin' rage
Burning inside you, so deep.

I'd give you anything
But I'd give you problems
So be with anyone you want
It's alright with me.

I hear it in your voice
I see it in your lips
There's always a catch
I guess that's alright with me

When no one's around
'Cause the map says you're here
Now I can hear a loneliness
Screaming in my ear.

Oh, time is over
Don't you know that
If a time won't pause or burn

Take it easy, there's no time to be mad
That's their job, blood on their teeth, death on their mind
Pretty baby, please just get out of the way, where it's safe
Eyes will follow you, weapons can't break through
Tears will swallow you, they all can see right through...

Bulletproof glass.
Bulletproof glass.
Bulletproof... you're in trouble now.
But who knows?
But who knows?

Please don't deceive me, I'm just so easily fooled
But there's some things they do not want the answers to
Don't want to bring all that up, but they keep leaving it out
What to do?
We'll just let it be until they all need...

Bulletproof glass.
Bulletproof glass.
Bulletproof... you're in trouble now.
But who knows?
But who knows?

If you want to know somebody, might take a quick look at their best friends
Diamonds are hers, a dog is his
You can lie to yourself, but don't lie to me
It's what they want
Dominance and loyalty, romance and security
Stay behind...

"Running in the parking lot I'm four years old
I am lost, those were the days
The soft murmur of voices in the other room
Comforting you as you fall asleep
Staring at the mother-daughter clones go by
We're in a race against time
And time might be winning

And it's not going to take all day though
Watching the urban decay
All around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way, oh, somewhere
Feels like I'm going left and right in the dark

How long must she wait, how long must you stay

Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Wake up
Wake up  

I am ashamed I think maybe sometimes
I might have used tricks to make you like me more
When I found you I was running wild
Let's get outta here
What's the trouble there

I wanna know
What were they thinking
'Cause I think
I think it too

Sliding across the Indian wilderness
Like the wind riding down sore throats
Six a.m now you're in Hollywood
And you're dancing, we made it
We are turning with the earth so fast
That it feels a lot slower

And it's not going to take all day though
Watching the urban decay
All around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way, oh, somewhere
Feels like I'm going left and right in the dark

How long will it take to fix what can't break

Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Wake up
Wake up 

Your Achilles heel is you like to feel your fingers on the wheel
Some live in the bottle, some live in the zoo
With the director and the actor and the crew and the viewers
Boys get their toys and girls got their dolls and
Nothing much gets easier in the final stages

Are you spending today as the same
As your life in corruption and temper in the way

Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Oh wake up 
Wake up 
Wake up

"Everything seems to go wrong when I stop drinking.
Everything seemed to go my way last night.
Everything seems so wrong to me this morning.
I know things will be brighter later tonight.
On Ludlow St.
Chinatown's coming on Ludlow St.
Puerto Rican's are runnin' on Ludlow St.
Soon, musicians will haunt it on Ludlow St.
Where Indians once hunted.
And it's hard.
Just move along.

While I surrendered my ego you fed yours.
All my fantasies died when you said yours.
I have dangled my pride to forget yours,
Will my mind be at ease when you get yours?
We'll find out soon enough.

It started back in 1624.
The Lenape tribes would soon get forced from their home.
Soon we'll all get pushed out as soon as I get sober.
I remember why I drank it all away.
On Ludlow St.

Nauseous regrets are calling me on the phone
My shoes, they seem to be my only home.
The only thing to last will be my bones.
Oh, tonight you'll hear the animals next door to you moan.

On Ludlow St.
Faces are changing on Ludlow St.
Yuppies invading on Ludlow St.
Night life is raging on Ludlow St.
History's fading.
And it's hard to just move along.

While I surrendered my ego, you fed yours.
All my fantasies died when you said yours.
I have dangled my pride to forget yours.
Will my mind be at ease when you get yours?
We'll find out soon enough.

While they defended their ego, you fed yours.
All their fantasies died when you said yours.
They have dangled their pride to forget yours.
Will their souls be at ease when you get yours?

"Somewhere along the way, my hopefulness turned to sadness
Somewhere along the way, my sadness turned to bitterness
Somewhere along the way, my bitterness turned to anger
Somewhere along the way, my anger turned to vengeance

And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it
And the ones who deserved it, they'll never understand it.
Yes, I know I'm going to Hell in a leather jacket
Least I'll be in another world while you're pissing on my casket

How could you be, oh
So perfect for me?
Why can't you ignore, oh
The things I did before?

Somewhere along the way, exacting vengeance gave excitement
Somewhere along the way, that excitement turned to pleasure
Somewhere along the way, that pleasure turned to madness
But sooner or later that kind of madness turns into pain

And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it
Those who helped me along the way, I smacked 'em as I thanked 'em
Yes, I know I'm going to Hell in a leather jacket
'Least I'll be in another world while you're pissing on my casket

And all that I can do is sing a song of faded glory
And all you got to do is sit there, look great, and make 'em horny
Together we'll sing songs and tell exaggerated stories
About the way we feel today and tonight and in the morning

How could you be, oh
So perfect for me?
Why can't you ignore, oh
The things I did before?

Take all your fears, pretend they're all true
Take all your plans, pretend they fell through
But that's what it's like

That's what it's like for most people in this world
The rich or the poor oh,
Muslims or Jews oh,
When roles are reversed oh,
Opinions are too
No, oh oh

That's all I'm gonna say now
Before they come knocking on my door now",6
"We might be in for a late night
Stuck in a lava flow of brake lights
I can hear a rattling bass drum driving back to where it came from
Sit back

I shop therefore I am the cause, protect me from what I was

Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it
Timing is everything, timing is everything, timing is everything, timing is everything
Timing is everything, timing is everything...

I'm at your feet, where critters meet
Who should be asleep and not crossing roads or highways
In the afterlife of super cities, rapidly devouring its outskirts
It's neon octopus arms redecorating late at night

Robot camp for kids who hate sports
Mothers crying at the airport
Finding the dreams you left behind to do, waving goodbye your young heart cries for you
Sit back

You're finding it hard to get very far
But we were born waiting in line
Grabbing the future by the eyes

Getting the hang of it, getting the hang of it, timing is everything, timing is everything
Getting the hang of it, timing is everything, getting the hang of it, timing is everything
Timing the hang of it, getting is everything,
Getting the timing of everything hanging is
Hanging the getting of timing the everything...

Like batteries we die, like rivers we dry
We fuel and recharge, that's humans and cars
My fun, my sun, be my homework done
Where did you go, you were my ride home

Is that what we want, is everything shot, is that what you ask for, 'cause that's what we got?

Nothing stands still
Nothing stands still",5
"I wish that clouds could hold me up like I thought as a child growing up
I wish I could sound as soothing as the rainfall
But I am only a drop from the storm.

I feel like a tourist out in the country
Once this whole world was all countryside
Feel like a tourist in the big city
Soon I will simply evaporate

They took the strings up north, the drums down south
After they crossed Afghanistan a long time ago
You're shuffling your feet into the next dimension
Soon skyscrapers will be everywhere

I feel like a tourist lost in the suburbs
Soon the whole world will be urban sprawl
Feel like a land lover out on the ocean
Feel like a teardrop streaming off your chin

Some will bet against you, try even to prevent you
But not many can stop you man, if you got a perfect plan
Can they possibly try, I demand to know why they would doubt you?
In this hand, a thousand generations

Feel like a tourist out in the desert
So hot it feels like the Devil's breath
Feel like a tourist out in the swampland
This world is just patches of water and land
Everywhere I go I'm a tourist,
But if you stay with me, I'll always be at home",6

Reynard left and went to Warwickshire, to a mound near a railway line,
With canals and a freezing swamp. He climbs high up above the countryside
And breathes freely. To the south he could see Polesworth, and to the
North he could just make out the ruins of the priory where Joss and I
Played cricket as children. We were only three miles away, probably drinking
Tea and talking,

(Have you heard about the orphan, sitting by the coffin)

At the same time as he was taking the stanley knife out of
The bag. He pushed the point into his stomach,

(His Father's not a sinner no more)

until the light shone right
Through. And then he reached down, and he took the bag.
It's a plastic bag
With plastic handles
And plastic sides

Sometimes I have you in my head
And loving with you I am happy
I think of things to say to you
Of evenings respenting another place

And everything feels so good here
Hand in hand in this other place
The things I do make you stare
Oh I wouldn't have it any other way

I sit alone and take care of my head
Or the feelings that I have in front of me

Break the chain awhile
Pretend that we just met

As if I need to know am I your basic whore
Just don't tell me that your love is on the line
I'm sure the truth will tell, just give it some more time
I'm sick and tired of playing your little game
(If you tell me your side I will tell you mine)
I'd like to know if you can finally change
(If you tell me your side I will tell you mine)

Why don't you believe my story
I won't tell you lies
You know it's not my dream
And if I tell you lies
You'll only realize

This isn't working out, I can't go on like this
Can't you save her Lord 'cause I just seem to miss
There's only so much one can do to save a friend
I've given her my all, it's useless to the end
Please don't let her die, my mind just won't accept
She is not the kind of girl that's strong or has respect

Denies my feelings
From those who can see
Your sacred wisdom
Can caress my soul
Confused and forsaken
By what I've been told
It always sounded so right to me
To offer my prayers
With the hope to be free 
Mother Mary, is this wrong for me
To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me

I've heard your words
In so many ways
Do I trust myself
Beyond your praise
My heart has been touched
By something said
I want to go with her
I want to be led
I knelt at your side
Did you feel me
I gave you my all
To be nearer to thee

Mother Mary, is this wrong for me
To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me

You know I'll always be there [Repeat: x3]

Can't you show me a way to believe
Have I been enlightened, misled or deceived
It always sounded so right to me
To offer my prayers
With the hope to be free

To judge myself by what you see
And if I stand here
Will you stand by me
If the choice that I make
Is the choice to be me",5

"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...

And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help

Nothing is a guaranteed
Don't hide your face; don't beg and plead
Being sorry for yourself
Put another record on

You're just another perfect flaw

In the end, we're all addicted

Swallow pride; it swallows you

Who's gonna help us in the end?
Not your brother, not your friend

Why don't you get a life?

Where all of God's creatures would love the human race

Despising it is what's so sad

Do something useful

"Heaven help the soul that's severed
From the place where it belongs
Caught up in the mindless struggle
Of the weak against the strong 
Headlights along the border
Keep the peace; their law and order

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
It's their kind of strength
It's their only defense
An imaginary line

Just a kid and his younger brother
Headed for the wire
Had no rights in the telescopic sights
Of the vigilante's rifle fire

And now he's buried on the border
Where the rivers are blood not water

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of truth
It can only be proved
With imaginary lines

In times like these concerning
Who decides which bridge is burning
Don't fall for map reading
Just make sure that you're still breathing

After the lines were drawn, the children would
Dream of the pearls and how beautiful they were
Year after year they would dive to the bottom of
The lagoon hoping that the oysters would come back
They risked everything - their homes, families
And meager possessions - to search for the pearls
To make sure they were heavy enough to reach the
Bottom, the children tied stones to their backs
Many of them died; streams of blood and broken
Bodies rose to the surface of the lagoon, and
The lagoon cried

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of strength
Their only defense
An imaginary line

Why can't we see it's all a record of lies?
(Why can't we see?)
It's their kind of truth
It can only be proved
With imaginary lines",6
"When they sell the final weapon, we can all watch it blow
Keep the people working, working
Keep the people working, working
Keep the people working, working
Gotta keep the people working

In the bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working

From the mines of anatolia to the isle of mandalay
Along the coast of sullen africa, they're queuing up to pay
No cause, I don't discriminate, I sell to those who buy
There never was an innocent who didn't want to die
And with demand upon the increase what could keep the cost down
If I keep the people fighting, I can really go to town
No surprise, the cash you borrow, we can close the deal tomorrow
Just swiss francs or dollars won't cause me any borrow, boy

In a bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
In a bed of iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working

Everybody itching for someone to serve the task
I'll arm the politician for the coup, the crew, the cast,
I have a score of different faces, I can look like a lord
Seen in high places, flying on the concorde

Well you can marvel at precision, you can dial a telephone
Call up color vision from the safety of your home
You can mount the great offensive from a button by the chair
If you arm the right system, you can ionize the air

In a bed of iron, they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
In a bed or iron they cast the final weapon
Just to keep the people working, got to keep the people working
Like the wind across the frontier or the breaking light of day
I push across the mountains, all around the bay of biscay

Freeze in north america, boil in pakistan
All along the amazon, from the fire to the frying pan

Whether air, sea or battle ground, desert sand or snow
When they sell the final weapon we can all watch it blow

You're just repeating past opinions

"Because of things remembered
Nothing changes; we simply follow
Rhythms that are distant echoes
Ancestors turning in their sleep
Silhouetted on the future
Playful figures that cut across the winking eye
Of God's projector
A partial eclipse of the original light
That eminates in all directions
So the darkness isn't pierced, but rather
Forced to retreat
Pushed out by its own internal explosion
The screen of God's movie is time expanding
And every atom is a solid globular mirror
In which His grotesque anamorphic grin
Splits the darkness!

[Chorus]
Everywhere our world's expanding
Journeys through the soul
Past all thought and understanding
Science or control

Looking to the future
Is looking at the past
In whichever direction you happen to face
You were forward, and I was slipping back
In the time it takes for the light of the stars to stir
The retina, rods and cones
History's in the beholder's eye
Fait accompli
Dans un outre androit
The further away we are, the farther back we see
Unless
We could gaze instantly across the sound
Where, moored like ships, planets anchored
Swing and sway
Golden barges laden down with mists and frozen crystals
Dancing away!

"Open the door to me
It's raining outside
Drenched in life's misery tonight
This lonely night
Day for day

She won't be home tonight
Because our luck has changed
And nothing stays the same

When the sky falls down
Does it make a sound
On the other side of town?
So we live with less
Love and happiness
On the other side of town

I cry to sleep
Wondering who
Cradles you softly and true
Day for day
With the stars falling at our feet
All the time
We were living down on easy street

"Hate city rivals, first pulse and then freakola
Dreaming of redemption; no end
To the living edit, the sound of amputation
Or the centrifugal pull of an endless bend
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down 
There's a shimmering dog sayin' danger; what's at work here?
The in-growing twitch of faceless laughter
A cause without end to serve forever
The missionary madness of the sacrificial lamb

[Chorus]
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down

On the hero's tomb is written
Not what he was but what he should've been
And nothing you can do will change the circumstances
Just a mild infuriation with statistics of sin

[Chorus]

A circular lie in a calibrated order
Weathering time with salt and water
Tears that you cry are your endeavor
To break into the madness of imaginary lines, until...

You shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Till you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot, shoot that rebel king down
Till you shoot; shoot that rebel king down
Not until you shoot; shoot that rebel king down",4
"Take me home for the ride
I won't be alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't be alone
We won't be alone tonight

I am standing in the shadows of the garden
Confessing to the pale moon above
If I tell you how I feel
You might harden
I'm scared of being lonely
And of dying without love

Take me home for the ride
I won't cry alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't cry alone
We won't cry alone tonight

I need everything I know you could provide me
But every time I love the flower dies
There's a darkness in the air
That seems to guide me
If you want to see the heartache
You can look into my eyes

Take me home for the ride
I won't die alone
Take me home for the ride
You won't die alone
We won't die alone tonight

Sometimes our emotions make it hard
For us to see that
At the heart of loving is respect and honesty
And sometimes I'm afraid that I give
Less than I should give
But this time I will hold you
For as long as I live
I won't die alone
You won't die alone
We won't die alone tonight",5
"Would you rather the feeling
Of no feeling at all?
A soundless sea that slips toward
The morning shore, where you stand transfixed
Void of emotion, no clue of a notion 
Transfixed like a stone
Enthralled by the feeling of no feeling at all

[Chorus]
Pushed by my sail
I am moved by the whale
As he floats through life's seas
He seems always at ease
Show me how

Centurions guard the finely-tuned sensors
That tremble at the slightest onset of stirrings
Which switch the dampers to absorb the emotion
And trigger the filter that screens out
Time and passing
Transfixed like a stone
Enthralled by the feeling of no feeling at all

[Chorus]

What ya gonna do when it hits the fan?
Open your mind; make a brand new plan
Do you realize that it's in your head?
Want to understand but refuse instead
If you take a deep breath and inhale
Maybe you can understand the whale
We either comprehend or we seem to fail

"And she cries when the rain begins to fall.
And she hides from the shadows on the wall,
'Cause she knows there is nothing she can do at all.
Goodbye.

She lives for him.
He is her only sin.
She prays to god
That he'll come back again.
She'll let him go,
And never let it show.
Oh, oh, oh,
And she cries.

And she walks by his house most every day.
And she lies to herself as if to say:
I don't need him; he was no good for me anyway.
Goodbye.

She lives for him.
He is her only sin.
She prays to god
That he'll come back again.
She'll let him go,
And never let it show.
Oh, oh, oh,
And she cries.

She's living a dream that won't come true.
She's living a nowhere point of view.
No, nobody knows what she's been through.
She'll do anything he wants her to;
There's not really much else she can do.
Who knows, maybe tomorrow.

You know she lives for him.
He is her only sin.
She prays to god
That he'll come back again.
She'll let him go,
And never let it show.
Oh, oh, oh,
And she cries.
And she cries...
And she cries...",5
"You know that true love's always hard to find
But it seems it's harder when true love divides
I want to believe
That we can move on without the pain
And I want to believe
That we can move on without the blame
We can't somehow,
We tear ourselves apart
And leave a broken heart.

If we believed in love
We wouldn't worry 'bout the problems of tomorrow,
There'd be a strength inside of us
To last the rest of our lives,
We'd never break away, never let go,
We'd never break away, never let go.

I feel that I've been torn apart in two
My empathy walks hand in hand with you
I just want to be free
From all of the guilt I feel inside
I just want to be free,
So I can release my selfish pride.
It's hard for us
To dry our crying eyes,
It's no surprise to see.

If we believed in love
We wouldn't worry 'bout the problems of tomorrow,
There'd be a strength inside of us
To last the rest of our lives,
We'd never break away, never let go,
We'd never break away, never let go.

And I want to believe
That we can move on without the pain
And I want to believe
That we can move on without the blame
We can't somehow,
We tear ourselves apart
And leave a broken heart....",5

A thousand lifetimes, you must have lived them all,
We took our chances, I love the way you fall.
Over there, I see you over there,
Tossed around the sun,
I can feel you everywhere tonight.

Don't leave me cold,
Living life without you - cold,
Dreams don't always come true - cold,
Everything we've been through,
Don't leave me cold.

You are the flower, growing in my hand,
Hour by hour, the more I understand,
A million colors, of woman and a man.
Over there, I see you over there,
Tossed around the sun,
I can feel you everywhere tonight.

Don't leave me cold,
Living life without you - cold,
Dreams don't always come true - cold,

And if I die, I die in peace, part of all that god has planned,
'Cause I believe in you and the best is yet to come,
You've been alone it's true, daddy's work is never done.
In my dreams, every night, I see the waves upon the sand
And you and I walk alone and there's a ring upon your hand.
Yes I believe in you and if my prayers are answered now,
I'm coming back , to you, I'm gonna find a way somehow.

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day.

Where you are is all there is, the only place I want to be
And love is war and war is cold, when you're so far across the sea.
Still I'm alive, still in love, I hope this letter finds you well,
Through the blood, through the flames, I can hear those wedding bells.

I'm making my way, each morning I pray for you,
Day after day,
I'll turn every stone, until I get home to you,
Day after day.

Darling you know the winds of peace are blowing,

Still I can hear the fallen angels singing,

How could you be so blind?

Come sing me a song.
Show me the way to go home.
I've been disconnected,
Loved and rejected,
Travelling inside of my soul.

And I've clenched my fist
And I've cried for love
And I've prayed for the other souls out of control
And the answers that came from above.

And it's good to be lonely sometimes,
It's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely sometimes,
At least I'm prepared for the fall
And it's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely.

Rain on the train tracks,
The beat of my heart,
The rhythm of life carries on,
In memories and dreams
Of the faces and places,
I know I'll always belong.

And I've cried for love
And I've prayed for the other souls out of control

All my fears
And all my doubts
And all my secrets
Have found me out.

It's better than nothing at all.
It's good to be lonely sometimes,
At least I'm prepared for the fall
And it's better than nothing at all.

How many times can you feel your own pain
And how many days of your life are prediction,

A touch beyond temptation,
A vision beyond vogue,
One of god's finest creations.

There is nothing that could match her.

To touch her in a place,
Beyond the anguish of the chase,
Far from the endless race,
A love beyond embrace.

Well it's the kiss beyond the catcher,
There is nothing that could match her.
Nobody knows which way she goes!?
Nobody knows which way she goes!?

Well she's sitting there alone,
Like a queen upon a throne,
If she'd only catch my glance,
Then I might have half a chance.

There is nothing that could match her.

There's nothing you can do to make me smile.

To warm her heart and make her want to stay,
(If not) I'll be on my way!
(That's what they say) I'll be on my way!

It's the little boy inside,
That forces me to hide,
When the walls I'm breaking through,
Make me separate from you,
When all I wish to do
Is say that I love you.

Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",6
"Dear when you smiled at me, I heard a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart",8
"Raisans
The lights exploded
She stood burning in front of me
She ripped my heart out, and gave it to me
My eyes wouldn't open, cemented to her face
Have I begun a feeble chase
I'll be down, I'll be around
I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be
I'll just stare and hope you'll care
There's only everything standing in front of me
I know what you did to me
I know what you did was wrong
You're allowed to torture me
Wait a moment until I'm gone

I know you're the ticked, you gotta be
'Cause I let you be alone for long
Got to do something mean to me
Got to do something so I can't hang on

You're killing me 
You're killing me 
You're killing me 
You're killing me 
You're killing me

"Well I wake up every morning and the first thing that I say
Is that I hope that I can make it through another lonely day
I'm afraid I might explode if I keep going on this way

People always notice me wherever I go
They think I'm lucky but they don't really know
Beauty and brains are all that I've got
I've got a cold cold bed and a broken heart, a broken heart

Everybody loves me, everyone but you
But nobody undoes me like the thought of you can do
They search my eyes but I don't know why
''cause all I ever do is cry
Everybody loves me but you

Girls want to be me so they can pick and choose
They figure out of ten men there's no way that they can lose
Men would walk the plank for me and set themselves on fire
What do they see in me that isn't sad and tired, tired

I could fill my life with people who want to be with me
Do like when they say there's other fish in the sea
There's a world out there and a million things to do
But what do I care if it doesn't include you, you

Everybody loves me, everyone but you
But nobody undoes me like the thought of you can do
They search my eyes but I don't know why
''cause all they ever do is cry
Everybody loves me

A cold cold bed and a broken heart
An empty house and a broken car
A cold cold bed and a broken heart",3
"He falls down drunk, I hold him up
He drinks and I refill his cup
Then I take him home and put him to bed
He wakes me in the dead of night
Lets me be his second sight
To guide him when he's sleep-walking
Listen when he's sweet-talking
I see the end of the road in his eyes
He's got a long way to go

I hold him like a loaded gun
I know he might go off with anyone
But I know he's only tryin' to have some fun
He sees a couple of things in me
Like how I'm not very hard to please
It's really pretty easy
I see my long lost home in his eyes
He sees a nice hotel in mine

I'll stick it out forever babe
If we keep coming back together maybe
You'll start to see it like me

I'll stick it out forever babe
If we keep coming back together maybe
You'll start to see it like me

"I shut the windows and close the store
I lay down on the bathroom floor
Everyone I know is a bore.

I'm starting to think that everything stinks
That I could really use a drink
Then I got up and hit my head on the sink.

Father father father father, do you call
Father father father, should I end it all.

Now, here comes the song I love so much
Makes me want to go fuck shit up
Now, I got Nirvana in my head
I'm so glad I'm not dead
I slam my hand in the car door
I scream 'till I could scream no more
Bloody and mean and rotten to the core

Father father father father, do you call
Satan Satan Satan, should I end it all

You try to get off the ground
But you always end up coming down
When the sound comes around and goes in your ears
You can do anything you have no fears
When that sound comes around and goes in my ears
I can do anything I have no fears

Now, here comes the song I love so much
Makes me want to go fuck shit up

I'm so glad I'm not dead

I was a virgin then.
I was alone and I still am.

Here comes the pain
Feel like an alien.
I am my only friend.

"What's that over there moving on the wall
A second glance and it's not there at all
What's that sitting there on the page of my book
It hides behind the words when I try to take a closer look

I can't reach out and grab it but that's ok with me
What's that jumping up and down in the middle of the street
It lingers then it melts into the wavy liquid heat
What are all those dizzy circles in the corner of my eye
They laugh and float away as I look into the sky
Can't get my arms around it but that doesn't bother me
'cause all I have to do is dream

I see you every place I go
I see you in people I don't even know
I close my eyes and I see you
I open 'em wide and I see you
I see you

Who am I to close my mind from what it wants to see
And who are you to tell the truth and kill my fantasy
Why are all those people always saying things about me
I'm not a loser, I'm just lonely
Yeah I wanna lay down next to you
But I'm not one to complain
Yeah I wanna touch you too

Do me a favor and appease my aching eyes
Won't you please materialize
Play another of your tricks with my sight
Be here in the flesh tonight

What's that pretty little thing crawling up my wrist
Call me crazy, call me a masochist
But I'd rather have you in my mind than completely out of sight
So I'll just go on dreaming for the rest of my life

I see you every night and day
I see you in a million different ways
I close my eyes and I see you
I open 'em wide and I see you
Yeah, I see you

I wanna leave but I stay in my seat

And I don't need a mirror to see that it's true

Ask me a question then I will mess up, ooh
I'll tell a lie and I'll never fess up
I'm pretty lost but I don't wanna be found
No no no no no
My tiny screams don't make a sound, no

Feel my psyche
Make it last
Put this moment under glass

Nobody really can do that
What a low fantasy
She don't know how to live

So alone
Somebody take me home
Alone too long it drags on
It's so wrong, so alone, so alone

Catatonic insomniac lying in the grass
What is she thinking of, overlooked by everybody?
A long embrace though you won't see it on her face

She's so alone
Somebody take me home
Alone too long it drags on
It's so wrong, so alone, so alone

Feels like an end, so much unsaid
Feels like an end, so much unsaid

So alone, somebody take me home
Alone too long it drags on

So alone, so alone, so alone",5
"I have a sweet creamy warm little jelly roll.
I have a mind to just let my whole body go.
Thought I was hungry but now I don't really know.
If you don't want it you simply just say no.

You look so human but hey one can never tell.
I got no secrets and I think that you should know
Life ain't a party, it's not like a video.

 I don't know what I like only know what I don't.
I don't like what I know only love what I don't.
I know the fire but none of the afterglow.
Killing the irony that's ruining rock+roll.

This is a recurring theme
You die in flames in my dreams

""I need to get more sleep.""
This is what you always say
Lying in a junkie's way

Finding you turning blue
It's easy to discern the truth
I can see what not to do
One look at you the dying proof

Pick up your cigarette
Forget what I said
It's so hard to care what you do

You say, ""Look at me
Respectfully."" I can't

Am I supposed to lie down and die?",6

Am I only dreaming, or did I wake up dead?
Throw me in the garbage, shackled up in chains
But I still got my boots on
So I can walk away

You gotta try to stay alive
Leave me to the vultures
Throw me to the wolves
I'll live on tomorrow
And purity of soul

Dump me in the ocean
Tied to a piano
But you forgot to rip my heart out
Before you let me go

A heartbeat says you haven't died
You gotta try to stay alive

Lock me in the basement
Without anything to eat
You can hurt my body
But you can't hurt me",5

It's killing me, my darling, my darling, my darling
Tell me, what can I do? Help me help you

Sweet on the outside, but bitter on the inside
I'm giving up now, but I swear to God I really tried
I was happy as a child",6

Got to tell myself what I need to know

This hotel has a thirteenth floor
I'm thinking out the window
""Come up and watch a video.""

Did you ever see the birth
Or first steps of a tune?
Beautiful to me
And alien to you

It has got a face only I could love
And I know my place outside the hub

He's someone that you kinda know
He's someone that you'd like to know
You kiss him on the cheek and go
You gotta go and be alone

I think it is a fad so I don't feel so bad anymore.
You're so down on me
I think it is a fad so I don't feel so bad anymore.

You buy the pound just to burn it down
And watch the sleeping dogs die
Walk away unscathed
I'm going to take you off my thank-you list
Will you ever get your shit together? 

Hookers and virgins, sluts and nuns
What if I am neither one?

With the pride of lions you rub me the wrong way
Stick your hand in the cookie jar, pull out bad poetry.

My face has changed
I don't look the same
A human mutation
Alienation factory
Too much information, maybe.

What a bad judge of character you were
I would fake it if I could
It would probably be for my own good
Honesty is a curse
It only makes it worse.

I want to want you

Runs like a dream
No demons in your machine

This must be a joke.

Buy her the rock she always wanted
Throw money out the window
And watch the happy people catch it.

Well, I can.
I'll send you to a posh rehab
So you can get clean and it won't be so bad.
Let's buy guitars for all the kids.

Nobody can stop us from blowing it all.
It's mine and besides, they never cared what I did.

And it doesn't matter where you go
And it doesn't matter where you are.

Nobody can stop us from blowing it all.
It's mine and besides, they never cared what I did.

Let's do it now while we still can
Before they take it away
Take it back

Check us out checking in
Ordering room service
We'll have one of everything
And we'll leave a one hundred percent tip.

Nobody can stop us from blowing it all
It's mine and, besides, they've never cared what I'm saying.

Tars of joy and pride

That your house on the beach
Will fall into the sea.

Live it up 'cause you're going down
Live it up 'cause you're going down

This reign can't last
It'll all dry up so fast
The planets are flying past you
You think it's only natural
That the world will stop
And wait for you
And wait for you if you fall off.

Live it up 'cause you're going down
Live it up 'cause you're going down
Live it up 'cause you're going down

We lie in wait, we salivate
Visualizing your head on a plate.

You're sinking in the mud

Hold on to your jewels
You can hawk them later
A variation on a theme :
You're not missing anything.

They're broken as they're made.

Can't give you any more

It's not supposed to be like this
Can this be all there is? 

You keep pushing your luck
Too stupid to give up
You dream bigger
You fall harder.

You think of all the things that never will.

Take me on public transit

Never really touching the ground.

Dirty pictures in my bag.

Am I ever going to meet your kid?

No guts to tell me yourself
Go ahead and rub my nose in it
You can't fire me because I quit

You make me feel invisible

Stretched out on the floor of your house
Foaming at the mouth
With a needle in my arm
Next to a smoking gun
And an empty razor case
And a note that says :

Dear jack I hate you. love, Diane
Dear jack I hate you. love, Diane
Dear jack I hate you
I said yeah yeah yeah whoa.

The neighborhood is gonna watch me
As I create the great finale
A perfect swan dive out the window
Crash the car off the road

You're not gonna miss me
But you're gonna remember my body
Crumpled in a heap in the middle of your street.

Clean up your mess 
Clean up your mess
Clean up your mess
Clean up your mess

Finally you're carrying me
Over the threshold try to revive me
With a cold compress but it's too late
I guess your best just isn't good enough
When every warm embrace
It was a selfish act
And every smiling face
It was a trap
You shit
You stabbed me in the back

Dear jack I hate you. love, Diane
Dear jack I hate you. love, Diane
Dear jack I hate you
I said yeah yeah yeah whoa.

Clean up my mess

Stretch like a panther
Throw off the covers
Run to the mirror, my lover
Admire this face

We are improvising me.

You are the camera
You try to seduce me
You are the camera
You love me
I make love to you
You are the camera.

I practice different smiles
I rehearse different lines
Like the perfect comeback or an eloquent speech
Let's take a walk on the street on the stage
Don't say anything
Just follow me
Don't leave
Save me for posterity
What do I want to be seen buying? 
I write in my diary
Only what I want you to read.

You are the camera
A reason for living
You are the camera
I need you to need me
(I need you to justify my life)
You are the camera.

We sit down on the couch
On the left or on the right? 
What is my good side? 
Come in for a close-up
Fresh breath, perfect makeup
Are we gonna kiss on the mouth like I read about? 
I look right at you and see myself and I'm in love.

A reason for living
You are the camera
In the presence of greatness
You are the camera
I disappear what you're not here

You never needed anyone

Your invitation to dine

"Spin the bottle
He's a movie star, only drives rented cars.
Met him in a bar, said ""I know who you are.""
Took him to my party as the games were starting.
Bottle's on the ground, are you ready now?
When it comes to me, I'm gonna be ready.
It's my turn in a minute, gonna put my message in it.
 Five minutes in the closet with you.
 He's in a bunch of movies, really stupid movies.
It's not entirely his fault, he can't control it all.
I am not afraid, I can hardly wait.
Truth or dare, I don't care, tell the truth I dare you.
 When it comes around, when it comes around,
When it comes around, when it comes around. 
 Do you feel it too, what I feel for you?
If it was just us, would you do what I do?
 Doo-doo-doo-doo. Doo-doo-doo-doo.
Doo-doo-doo-doo. Doo-doo-doo-doo.
 Everybody's watching. Everybody's looking.
She's such a sucker. He don't want to fuck her.
He is gonnna kiss me, if he doesn't miss me.

Too far gone to even speak 
Neil Young on the radio 
Four dead in Ohio 

Daddy are you asleep? 
Your son's a mess 
And your daughter's a freak 
And when you hit the road 
This time it's a heavy load 

We tried everything to get you back 
Even sprung a junkie from rehab 
I'll have another drink 
If it makes you laugh 
We'll try anything 
Because we love you daddy 

Michael and me 
A long long time ago 
We were a family 
And I don't want to let you go 
This life is all we know 
We tried everything 
To get you to laugh

Because we love",5

And come three hours late 
You can steal my concept 
And drink my wine 
And break my shades 
You can flip me over from behind

I'm not down with the dirty dog",4

And affection

It doesn't really matter anyway 
One more time 
We're all gonna die someday

Everybody sing 
My feeling for you endures like cancer 
Get in line, get in line, get in line 
I'm giving myself away 
Like a jaded ingenue 
I tried so hard to get you out of my mind 
But the lies I tell myself 
They break down over time 
Throwing rocks at clouds 
To tear their silver linings 
Knocking rainbows down 
To keep myself from climbing

Maybe big in France

It should've been you
But a singer without a song
Who never realized the night is long
When you're sober and out of luck
They'll steal your best lines and your haircut
It should've been you

Lying here with my younger man
He's good-looking but he doesn't understand
That who I am is not my clothes or my car
He's got no soul
But he's a rock star

It should've been you
And I know I'm a fair-weather fuck
I only want you when you're on top
I'm afraid when I feel your love
I turned away
But I'm not better off
It should've been you",5

Because Jamie's back in town

I don't want him to see me 
On a binge 
Na, na, na, na, na

Go on take aim when I open my mouth 
I still love my enemy 
I still love my enemy 
You appointed me the stoic one 
Not allowed to cry these tears

You pushed inside 
Impossible to love

You didn't mean to hate me

He's been no one for forty years 
He wanted to live like a rolling stone 
With a beautiful wife 
And city and country homes 
Singing in the shower 
He's off tonight 
He's been no one all of his life 
Singing in the shower 
No one can hear 
He's been waiting for forty years 
Tears in his eyes 
Washing away 
Singing in the shower 
No one can hear

Singing in the shower 
Got no stage fright 
He's been practicing all of his life",6

Sunshine and freedom
A beautiful day
I just couldn't stay
Inside love's prison

But some rainy Sunday I'll wake from a dream
And wonder if you miss me
Some rainy Sunday I'll see things your way
And wish that you were with me

Telephone calls just hit the wall
And you can't see my side
Tied up with you in a manic mood
I just scream goodbye

Some rainy Sunday I'll wake from a dream
And wonder if you miss me
Some rainy Sunday, I'll see my mistake
And wish that you were with me

Ohhh, ohhh

Some rainy Sunday I'll wake from a dream
And wonder if you miss me
Some rainy Sunday, I'll see my mistake
And wish that you were with me",8

You get happy with a sugar buzz 
White chocolate is your favorite drug 
I go underneath the covers 
There are things I do not understand 
When I reach out will you slap my hand?

Now I'm waking up 
And I want to stand in the sunshine 
I have never been ecstatic 
Had a flower but it never bloomed 
In the darkness of my wasted youth 
It was hiding in the shadows 
Learning to become invisible 
Uncover me 
Weeping willow 
I've been sleeping 
I've been sleeping through my life 
Now I'm waking up 
And I want to stand in the sunshine 
Waking up 
Forgotten memories of 
Laughter and war 
That we lived through 
And all the people that I never knew 
I've been sleeping through 
My life 
Now I'm waking up 
And I want to stand in the sunshine 
I'm waking up

My heartache today, I can't tell you anymore

With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me

Believe me I know it's been hard for you
There's never an easy way to let it go
And I thought I saw your jacket in my room today
But that was yesterday, oh was that yesterday?

With a little courage, in time
You might forgive me
With a little loving, in time
You might forgive me

And I dreamt that you were telling me you dreamt of me
But now I'm waking up, oh I think I'm waking up

And it's not her first time
She lets you stay and then she leaves
Like a midnight sun when does she sleep?

You're just a tourist in her world
You're just a tourist in her world
You're just a tourist in her world

You want to capture her, but you can't find the words
You can touch her skin, but you're blind to the light within 
And in the morning she pulls off her mask 
Makes her brown eyes green
It's a private show, but everybody stares
She turns into a ghost
Of someone that you think you know, but you don't

You're just a tourist in her world

Waiting for something, I don't know what
They don't see me so they're not scared
But they tread lightly everywhere

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand

Sunset?s pink and orange and lavender and gray
There's a bird on a branch at the top of the tree
We wanted the world to give us a chance
Now we're pushed out to the edges

If we stand still blinded by the lights
Is it murder or suicide?

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Over the sand

Here comes the darkness
It comes down fast
Run to the ocean
Leave tracks in the sand

Because she's dying for a line
Tell her love is all we need

In simple truths like blood in the streets
Sugar is sweet and the sky is blue

"I stayed until the Star Spangled Banner played
And I couldn't keep my eyes open
I stayed till the buds dried up and fell off on the table
And there was no hope of my saving them
Till the last levee broke and the floods came and washed away our home

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long

I stayed till the last of the bottles was empty
And whizzing by my head
I stayed till there was no more air in the room
And my tears no longer moved you
Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long, I stayed too long

Next time maybe I will know how to walk away
With pride and grace and faith in myself
Knowing how the world works and the way that things change

Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again
Till you lied and you lied
And you lied and you lied and you lied again

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long

Then it was over and I will never be the same
I finally wised up but the fact remains
I stayed too long, I stayed too long

So if I get up and open the door
Don't let it go to your head

It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you

Your jealousy and insecurity can be so over the top
I get so fatigued by these long emotional relationship talks
I'd really much prefer my own company most of the time
I never said I can't live without you baby
I just said you look good tonight

Normally I'd be making tracks
There's only one reason I came back

It's just lust
It doesn't mean I love you
It's just lust
It doesn't necessarily mean that I even like you very much

Reason has no place in this vicious world

And I'm heading your way
Into your burning flame
It's the law of nature
It's the law of nature

I take what I need
Spit out the bones and seeds
Curl up with your skin to keep me warm
Reason has no chance in this selfish world

I don't listen to the preachers
I don't listen to the doctors
I don't listen to the leaders
Reason has no chance in this selfish world

And I'm heading your way
Into your burning flame

It's the law of nature

Always hungry for that heat, ooh, ooh, ooh

Reason has no chance in this vicious world

Into your burning flame

I still got the same face

But oh my baby doesn't love me anymore
Oh my baby doesn't love me anymore
I just know, I just know

He used to look in my eyes and talk to me
But now we just have sex and watch tv
And when he touches my body
There's something off with the chemistry

I feel him going through the motions
The same ones that still breed hope in me

Did he know me
Did he know
Did he ever
Where does love go when it goes
It's like a white bird in the snow

He used to want to make me breakfast
But more and more he's sleeping in
And though he doesn't want to hurt me
I know he'll soon be leaving

Well, don't I merit a mention?
Tell them how you're surrounded by idiots
How I was always much too stupid

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

You're holed up in your country estate surrounded by your sheep
They only love you because yours is the hand that feeds
But there's no stylistic variety
One of us is still hungry

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

Not coming back, I'm not coming back
Not coming back

I get no apology or a thank you or a please
When I suffer your neglect it's my responsibility
You lounge around your castle fingering your queen
With your chairs that no one sits on and your starched and ironed sheets
You have no faith in the future, you don't believe
That I still got the holy spirit in me

It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone
It was you or me so I left, now I'm gone

I'm not coming back
Not coming back, na, na, na, na

Translating every mystery of time and place

Away in the dark you made me feel something
And gave me a reason to keep trying

Your hands were filled with electricity
Like the moon and stars lit from within
Illuminating something asleep in me

Remember November, remember November
Away in the dark you made me feel something
And gave me a reason to keep trying

A great escape from a lonely life
A great escape from a lonely life

Remember November, remember November

Away in the dark you made me feel something

It's all still a mystery to me
I've forgotten what we were fighting for

Every light in my mind goes shining on
Every fire that died goes shining on
Every setting sun goes shining on
On and on and on, on and on and on

Do you need a resolution
To understand where the pain is coming from?
Were you accused of things you didn't do?
Or were you standing in the middle of a dream coming true?

Every light in my mind goes shining on
Every fire that died goes shining on
Every star at dawn goes shining on and on
On and on and on

Condemnations tears and lies released from memory
We will always be beautiful, beautiful
Condemnations tears and lies released from memory
We will always be beautiful on the night we kissed in the stairwell

Before we really knew each other yet
It may not be easy but we need to forget
All the mistakes, disasters and words
That should never have been spoken

Every light in my mind goes shining on
Every star at dawn goes shining on
Every setting sun goes shining on
On and on and on, on and on and on
On and on and on, shining on and on

You're so alone
You want to die and nobody knows

You keep leaving messages that don't say anything
Like, ""Hi, how's it going?"" pretending you're okay
You disguise your fear so you don't scare them away
You don't want to go to sleep because the nightmares keep you awake

Your heart is beating strangely
Nausea and pains throughout your body

You've told everyone who ever meant anything to you
To please just go away
And now you've got nobody what are you supposed to do
It's getting late and the night is getting darker

Is this really happening?
And I'm talking to myself
Is anybody listening?

"She writes songs at night
After everyone has turned out the lights
Though she's still young
She's had a hard life
And she's not giving up believing in fate
And it makes a person strong being alone for so long

The family home it's like living in a war zone
Holes are punched in walls
But no one seems to care at all

She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world
She's such a beautiful girl
And she lives in an ugly world

They want to knock that smile off her face
So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
So with patience she waits

No one ever had her back
They only laugh when she cries
But in God's eyes

They want to knock that smile off her face
So she shuts her door and she writes and dreams
It's her favorite escape
And she knows it can only get better
And with patience she waits

"I broke down on 14th street, I could have been blind
And you could have been anywhere in the world but I saw you in my mind
In flashing colors in the middle of the night

But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, it's a lonely love

I found myself in Brooklyn, it was as real as a dream
Then I went back up to Boston with absolutely nothing but a feeling

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground
But without the touch of flesh and blood this is a lonely love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, it's a lonely love

How I wish I could escape the human things
Don't take me for a woman, I am only the song you sing

This lonely love is all around, it's up in the air and underground

"Well, she started with a margarita
Then she went to straight tequila
And before the night was over, oh
Her little secret was between us
But she laughed, I cried
And she said, ""I'll be fine.""

Now she's barely walking and I'm thinking
Wonder how long she's been drinking, like this
She looks me in the eye and says, ""I swear I'm quitting.""
I almost believed it
Then she cried but she lies
Cause that's what she said last Saturday night

How am I suppose to help
Somebody when they tell you
That they don't need help
How am I suppose to reach a soul
That doesn't know they need to save themselves
My friend, I've done all I can do
You've got to
Help me, help you

Oh, I get home from work
I turn the TV on
The telephone's a ringing
Her little girl is crying
Says, ""I can't wake mama up from sleeping.""
Well, I burned that road
Opened up the door, she says,
""Leave me alone.""

In the back of the room

Then I went to straight tequila.""

Melt myself down to an end
And I have no way of ever coming back 'round here again
Or I could glow just like an amber
Rising out of an autumn fire
Drifting toward the heavens floating higher and higher
You better hide your matches boy

Cause I could spark like thin white paper
Wrapped tight 'round some cigarette
And leave nothing but the smell of smoke and the bitter taste of regret
Or I could get hot like them coals that turn the water into steam
And fall down around you like some misty morning
You better hide your matches boy
You better hide your matches boy

Oh, cause I'm bound to lose all I am right here in your arms
And it ain't gonna take much
And it ain't gonna take long
So you best turn your eyes if you're not ready tonight
To watch me burn like this
You better hide your matches

Cause I can't afford to let you go
I'm afraid to draw you near
Cause I could get so lost in you that I might disappear
And the words are on the tip of my tongue
But you won't hear a sound
Cause once that fire gets going there's no way to slow it down
You better hide your matches boy
You better hide your matches boy

You better hide your matches boy
Oh, yeah
You better hide your matches boy",6

A real player and that's a fact
But I wasn't having none of that

I can remember all the times on a Saturday night on my parents' couch
Had the house to ourselves sittin' through a movie and makin' out
He said I had somethin' that he couldn't live without
And I'd get soft
I didn't think about it

Jimmy Ray McGee asked me to the senior prom
But I went on another boy's arm
Heard he made someone else a mom
Oh Jimmy Ray McGee disappeared from our home town
Another daddy out runnin' around
Doin' everythin' but settlin' down yeahh

Oh yeah

Well I was seventeen but I thought too much 'bout the choices I made
From the clothes I wore to the friends I picked to the boys I'd date
I guess in the end it worth all the worry though it hurts to leave
It can hurt worse to hurry

Jimmy Ray McGee used to lean on his old corvette
Light up a cigarette
And that's why I hadn't loved him yet

Oh oh whoa",6
"Can't believe he took the coward's way out
And did it over the phone
If you ask me when it comes to him
You're better off alone
I hate to see my best friend
Feeling like a dead end
Thinking she was born to lose

[Chorus:]
I wish you could love yourself
Oh, I wish you could love yourself
The way that I do

He never really knew the side of you
That your friends all love
You gotta be who you are 'cause who you are
Is more than enough
There isn't any doubt
Inside and out
Your beauty comes shining through

[Chorus]

Oh, I wish you could love yourself
Yeah, I wish you could see you
The way that I see you

I wish you could love yourself
Oh, I wish you could see you
The way that I see you

[Chorus]

Oh yeah, oh yeah",7
"Look at me
Cant believe I finally made it here
Feeling like I'm where I belong
Singing my hallelujah song

Hard to find,
Took some time
But I that I might be hitting,
On whats been missing all along
Singing my hallelujah song

Its a highway sliding through
A Sunday avenue.
Its a snapshot smiling,
Like we ain't got nothing to lose

Its the peace in knowing,
That the earth is gonna be gone someday.
But you only get more,
When you give it away.

Look at me
Cant believe I finally made it here
Feeling like I'm where I belong
Singing my hallelujah song

Hard to find,
Took some time
But I that I might be hitting,
On whats been missing all along
Singing my hallelujah song

Its a sweet prayer.
Knowing someone's up there hearing me
Its a punchline,
Take a little time,
But I giving in

Life is more than,
How many breaths you take.
The moments that take
You're breath away.
Baby take my breath away!

Look at me
Cant believe I finally made it here
Feeling like I'm where I belong
Singing my hallelujah song

Yeah yeah

Hard to find,
Took some time
But I never was by myself
There were angels,
Helping me all along

Singing my hallelujah song
My hallelujah
My hallelujah
Singing my hallelujah song
Oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah",5
"I remember the shirt I was wearing And the way I was staring
When I saw your face

And how I felt as unstable
As the patio table
That September day

And Madonna was playing
From a car that was waiting
For the light to turn

And it only took a minute
The love that had me in it
And the fire began to burn

[Chorus]
It's insane, sane, sane
But I'd stand in front
Of a train, train, train
Just to hold your hand
In the pouring rain, rain, rain
Yeah I'd jump off a cliff, cliff, cliff
Just to kiss your pretty lips, lips, lips
I'd do anything I that gotta do
Just to be with
You, You, You

Well I'd seen you before
A couple times or more
I even called your friend

But when the stars were ready
You were always going steady
Up there on the fence

And when love came around
My guard was never down
I was quick on my feet

And I never would've thought
That I'd ever get caught
With my heart on my sleeve

[Chorus]

Well I would run every stop sign
And I don't care
I would always be the first one there

Just to see that look in your eyes
When you know that you never have to, have to ask me twice

[Chorus]

Just to hold your hand
Water your flowers
Hmm... Just to be with
You, You, You",6

"You were hangin' your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

(I) don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video

Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say

(But I've)
(I've had that song in my head all day)
(Playin' in my head all day)

I said, 'How 'bout an autograph for 'ya
Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumpin' away, and I
I've had that song in my head all day

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

"I'm Bert, p'raps you've heard of me
Bert, you've had word of me,
Jogging along, hearty and strong
Living on plates of fresh air
I dress up in fashion
And when I am feeling depressed
I shave from my cuff all the whiskers and fluff
Stick my hat on and toddle up West

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And saunter along like a toff
I walk down the Strand with my gloves on my hand
Then I walk down again with them off
I'm all airs and graces, correct easy paces
Without food so long I've forgot where my face is
I'm Bert, Bert, I haven't a shirt
But my people are well off you know.
Nearly everyone knows me from Smith to Lord Rosebr'y,
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow.

I stroll with Lord Hurlington,
Roll in The Burlington
Call for Champagne, walk out again
Come back and borrow the ink
I live most expensive
Like Tom Lipton I'm in the swim
He's got so much 'oof', he sleeps on the roof
And I live in the room over him.

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And saunter along Temple Bar
As round there I skip
I keep shouting 'Pip Pip!'
And the darn'd fools think I'm in my car
At Rothchilds I swank it
My body I plank it
On his front door step with 'The Mail' for a blanket
I'm Bert, Bert, and Rothchild was hurt
He said ' You can't sleep there' I said 'Oh'
He said 'I'm Rothchild sonny!' I said 'That's damn'd funny,
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow'

I smile condescendingly
While they're extending me
Cheer upon cheer when I appear
Captain with my polo team
So strict are my people
They're William the Conqueror's strain
If they ever knew I'd been talking to you
Why they'd never look at me again

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And reach Kempton park around three
I stand by the rail, when a horse is for sale
And you ought to see Wooton watch me
I lean on some awning while Lord Derby's yawning
Then he bids two thousand and I bid Good Morning
I'm Bert, Bert, I'd buy one, a cert
But where would I keep it you know
I can't let my man see me in bed with a gee-gee
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow!

My pose, Tho' ironical
Shows that my monocle
Holds up my face, keeps it in place,
Stops it from slipping away.
Cigars, I smoke thousands,
I usually deal in The Strand
But you've got to take care when you're getting them there
Or some idiot might stand on your hand.

I'm Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty
And Buckingham Palace I view.
I stand in the yard while they're changing the guard
And the queen shouts across ""Toodle oo""!
The Prince of Wales' brother along with some other
Slaps me on the back and says ""Come and see Mother""
But I'm Bert, Bert, and Royalty's hurt,
When they ask me to dine I say no.
I've just had a banana with Lady Diana
I'm Burlington Bertie from Bow.",5
"Place park, scene dark, silvery moon is shining through the trees;
Cast two, me, you, sound of kisses floating on the breeze.
Act one, begun. Dialogue, ""Where would you like to spoon?""
My cue, with you, underneath the silvery moon.

By the light of the silvery moon,
I want to spoon, to my honey I'll croon love's tune,
Honeymoon keep a shining in June,
Your silvery beams will bring love dreams, we'll be cuddling soon,
By the silvery moon.

Act two, scene new, roses blooming all around the place;
Cast three, you, me, Preacher with a solemn looking face.
Choir sings, bell rings,Preacher: ""You are wed for evermore.""
Act two, all through, every night the same encore.

By the light, (By the light, By the light),
Of the silvery moon, (The silvery moon).
I want to spoon, (Want to spoon, Want to spoon)
To my honey I'll croon love's tune.
Honeymoon, (Honeymoon, Honeymoon),
Keep a shining in June. (Keep a shining in June)

"I hear a bird, Londonderry bird,
It well may be he's bringing me a cheering word.
I hear a breeze, a River Shanon breeze,
It well may be it's followed me across the seas.
Then tell me please

How are things in Glocca Morra?
Is that little brook still leaping there?
Does it still run down to Donny cove?
Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay
How are things in Glocca Morra this fine day?",4
"Once I was young, yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul and kissed some other chaps
Once I was young, but never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too!

I didn't know what day it was
Then you held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say I'm all your own

I didn't know what year it was
Life was no prize
I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Once I was old, twenty years or so
Rather well preserved, the wrinkles didn't show
Once I was old, but not too old for fun
I used to hunt for little girls up my imaginary gun
But now I ain't for only one

I'm wise and I know what time it is now
I'm wise and I know what time it is now
I'm so wise and I know what time it is now",6
"If it were within our power,
Beyond the reach of slavish pride.
To no longer harbour grievances,
Behind the mask's opportunists facade.
We could welcome the responsibility
Like a long lost friend,
And re-establish the kingdom of laughter

In the dolls house once again.
For time has imprisoned us
In the order of our years,
In the discipline of our ways
And in the passing of momentary stillness
We can view our chaos in motion
And the subsequent collisions of fools
Well versed in the subtle art of slavery.",5

"Severance,
The birds of leaving call to us,
Yet here we stand
Endowed with the fear of flight.

Overland
The winds of change consume the land,
While we remain
In the shadow of summers now past.

When all the leaves
Have fallen and turned to dust,
Will we remain
Entrenched within our ways.

Indifference,
The plague that moves throughout this land
Omen signs
In the shapes of things to come.
Tomorrow's child is the only child.",4

Wipe the sleep from your eyes
And embrace the light.
You have slept now for a thousand years
Beneath starless nights.

And now it's time for you to renounce the old ways
And see a new dawn rise.

In former days
The masks were raised
When the god came down from off the mountain,
And a sacrifice was made
For they knew the day of WRATH
Was fast approaching.

Just like yesterday...
Before the war.

John Francis Dooley,
The scapegoat has run
All our sins are disowned.

And now it's time for you
To take off thy mask
And cross the Rubicon!

If you and I were one
Within the eyes of our designs,
It would still not change
The fact of our leaving.

For tonight we must leave
With the first gentle breeze.
For the Isles of Ken we are assailing!

Just like Ullyses, on an open sea
On an odyssey
Of self-discovery...",6

In the park we would play when the circus came to town.

Moved silently along the rainswept boulevard.

As the moon rose again
For the very first time.

You know what came of him
To him, complexities seemed plain
He cursed the hour that gave birth to him
And saw that everything was vain
How great and wise was Solomon

But soon observed what followed on
It's wisdom that had brought him to this state
How fortunate the man with none

You know what he became
They deified him in his life
Then had him murdered just the same
And as they raised the fatal knife
How loud he cried ""you too my son!""

The man who never lied
They weren't so grateful as you'd think
Instead the rulers fixed to have him tried
And handed him the poisoned drink
How honest was the people's noble son

But soon observed what followed on
It's honesty that brought him to that state
How fortunate the man with none

Here you can see respectable folk
Keeping to God's own laws
So far he hasn't taken heed
You who sit safe and warm indoors
Help to relieve out bitter need

In the spinning wheels of chance

I believe in a way of long ago
And the sounds I believe rose our glow
And we're changing our ways

Yes, we are taking on different roads
Tell me more about the forest
That you once called home

For the wind cries of late
In the whispering leaves
And the sun will turn to waste
The heavens we build above

Father, teach your children
To treat our mother well
If we give her back her diamonds
She will offer up her pearl

We must sing her creation song
Jeune du monde
Invoke the spirits that feed us
This dreaming takes too long

But I'm not bitter, no, I'm surviving
To face the world, to raise the future
So why don't you tell me, come on and tell me
About the world you left behind
Can you tell me?

And renounce temporal obligations.
Dream on my dear

You build me up then you knock me down.
You play the fool while I play the clown.
We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much

I don't believe you anymore ... I don't believe you.

We keep time to the beat of an old slave drum.
You raise my hopes then you raise the odds
You tell me that I dream too much
Now I'm serving time in a domestic graveyard.

Never let it be said I was untrue
I never found a home inside of you.
Never let it be said I was untrue
I gave you all my time.

"I need my conscience to keep watch over me
To protect me from myself
So I can wear honesty like a crown on my head
When I walk into the promised land

We've been too long American dreaming
And I think we've all lost the way
Forlorn somnambulistic maniacal in the dark

I'm in love with an American girl
Though she's my best friend
I love her surreptitious smile
That hides the pain within her

And we'll go dancing in the rings of laughter
And live along by the shores

Yeah-ee, on the lea the rising wind blows
Fay-hee, on the lea the rising wind blows
How long how long?

(?) In the grounds of (?) we've left behind
Turned back by the foot of the doorway
Never lost and found

We've been too long American dreaming
I think we've all lost the heart

Yeah-ee, on the lea the rising wind blows
Fay-hee, on the lea the rising wind blows
How long how long?",5
"Favored one, fade on, see them run
Journey 'round, heave ho all night long
You've been afraid for far too long
I've been enraged in my song
I've been a rose in my rage
I've been a rose
I've been a rose
I've been a rose
Canaan ran, since her desert song
Canaan ran, rides on the bird song
You've been afraid for far too long
I've been enraged in my songs

"I am stretched on your grave
And will lie there forever
With your hands held in mine
I'd be sure, we'd not sever

My apple tree, my brightness
'Tis time we were together
For I smell of the earth
And am stained by the weather

When my family thinks
That I'm safe in my bed
From night until morning
I am stretched at your head

Calling out to the air
With tears both hot and wild
Oh, I grieve for the girl
That I loved as a child

The priests and the friars
Behold me in dread
Because I still love you
My love and you're dead

I would still be your shelter
From rain and from storm
And with you in your cold grave
I cannot sleep warm

"Ever loved a woman who made you feel tall?
Ever loved a man who made you feel small?

If you were a sailor
I'd raise the anchor
To sail the sea
In search of you and me
And God

Conjures currents to break our fragile boats
And both the innocent and the damned
Are swallowed up in his wake

If you were a huntress
I'd be your bow
For your silver arrows
To seek out his heart

Ever loved a woman who made you feel tall?
Ever loved a man who made you feel small?

Who are you to complain
For lack of understanding?
We are all created equal
In just one thing alone

Alone in your thoughts that consume you through your life
They'll take you outwards to the dark edge of time

And there's nothing more dangerous
Than a man with nothing to lose
Nothing to live for
And nothing to prove",6
"From the body to the soul
Where our hearts lead we must go
Wherever love may flow",8
"I sat within the valley green
I sat me with my true love.
My sad heart strove the two between
The old love and the new love.
The old for her the new
That made me think on Ireland dearly.
While the soft wind blew down the glade
and shook the golden barley. 
'Twas hard the woeful words to frame
To break the ties that bound us.
But harder still to bear the shame
of foreign chains around us.
And so I said the mountain glen
I'll meet at morning early.
And I'll join the bold united men
While soft winds shook the barley. 
'Twas sad I kissed away her tears
My fond arm round her flinging.
When a foe, man's shot burst on our ears
From out the wild woods ringing.
A bullet pierced my true love's side
In life's young spring so early.
And on my breast in blood she died
While soft winds shook the barley. 
But blood for blood without remorse
I've ta'en at oulart hollow.
I've lain my true love's clay like corpse
Where I full soon must follow.
Around her grave I've wandered drear
Noon, night, and morning early.
With breaking heart when e'er I hear
The wind that shakes the barley.",6
"The river is deep and the road is long,
daylight comes and I want to go home. 
Awoke this morning
to find my people's tongues were tied
and in my dreams
they were given books to poison their minds.
The river is deep and the mountain high,
how long before the other side. 
We are their mortar,
their building bricks and their clay.
Their gold teeth mirror
both our joys and our pain.
The river is deep and the ocean wide,
who will teach us how to read the signs. 
The earth is our mother
she taught us to embrace the light,
now the lord is master
she suffers an eternal night.
You blocked up my ears,
you plucked out my eyes,
you cut out my tongue,
you fed me with lies, 
oh lord.",5
"If it were within our power,
beyond the reach of slavish pride.
To no longer harbour grievances,
behind the mask's opportunists facade.
We could welcome the responsibilty
like a long lost friend,
and re-establish the kingdom of laughter
in the dolls house once again.
For time has imprisoned us
in the order of our years,
in the discipline of our ways
and in the passing of momentary stillness
we can view our chaos in motion
and the subsequent collisions of fools
well versed in the subtle art of slavery.

"All your ships
Have left their moorings
Cast adrift
On the Sargasso Sea
Waiting for the wind
To set your sails free

When you reach
The end of your rainbow
Chasing shadows
And down on your luck
Look for the sign
Look for a sign

As you rise to the very top
Of your mountain
Just remember those
Poor lost souls
On their way down

You taught me patience
Was a virtue
I took my time
Let Nature take her cause
All was revealed
All in good time

Turn back your clocks
Open up your memories
Beneath the veil
Where time stands still
You showed me a sign
You showed me the sign",6
"Saw the demonstration
On remembrance day
Lest we forget the lesson
Enshrined in funeral clay
History is never written
By those who've lost
The defeated must bear witness to
Our collective memory loss

With every generation comes
Another memory lapse
See the demonstrations of
Failing to learn from our past
We live in the dream time
Nothing seems to last
Can you really plan a future
When you no longer have a past

Memories fall from the trees
Amnesia
Memories like autumn leaves

If we are subject to
Empirical minds
I wonder what lies beyond
Our memory's confines
If memory is the true
Sum of who we are
May your children know the truth
And shine like the brightest star

Memory, help me see
Amnesia
Memory, set me free

All my love and all my kisses
Sweet Mnemosyne
All my love and all my kisses
Sweet Mnemosyne

"We are ancients
As ancient as the sun
We came from the ocean
Once our ancestral home
So that one day
We could all return
To our birthright
The great celestial dome

We are the children of the sun
Our journey's just begun
Sunflowers in our hair
We are the children of the sun
There is room for everyone
Sunflowers in our hair

Throughout the ages
Of iron, bronze, and stone
We marveled at the night sky
And what may lie beyond
We burned offerings
To the elemental ones
Made sacrifices
For beauty, peace and love

We are the children of the sun
Our kingdom will come
Sunflowers in our hair
We are the children of the sun
Our carnival's begun
Our suns will fill the air

And you know it's time
To look for reasons why
Just reach up and touch the sky
To the heavens we'll ascend
We are the children of the sun
Our journey has begun

All the older children
Come out at night
Anemic, soulless
Great hunger in their eyes
Unaware of the beauty
That sleeps tonight

And all the queen's horses
And all the king's men
Will never put these children back
Together again

Faith, hope, our charities
Greed, sloth, our enemies

We are the children of the sun
We are the children of the sun",7
"Sometimes
I feel like I want to live
Far from the metropolis
Just walk through that door
Sometimes
I feel like I want to fly
Reach out to the painted sky
A prisoner to the wind 
A bird on the wing

Sometimes
I feel the ocean in my blood
See rain from the sky above
Her salt brined tears
And now
Those tears leave taste on my tongue
Like the warm rush you get from
Black opium
Black opium

Sometimes
I feel like I want to leave
Behind all these memories
And walk through that door
Outside
The black night calls my name
But all roads look the same
They lead nowhere
They lead nowhere",5
"[Bobby] Dear Erica, I would cherish you more than life itself.
[Yas] Wait, no you wouldn't.-
[Bobby] Don't Listen to him, he only cares about himself.-
[Yas] alright -
[Bobby] See I would be there through thick and thin,
in sickness and in health, from beginning to end.
You gotta decide, me or him, Erica, tell me I'm curious.
[Yas] Bobby, I didn't mean to cut you off but are you really being serious?
You sound delirious, I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Erica's my girl, she always has been, period.
She hates you, what makes you think she would date you?
You got a new girl, like every week, at least I'm faithful.
[Bobby] Erica, take my advice, like how long have you known me?
I know Yas, he's the kind that'd leave you stranded and lonely.
Why are you lying to me?
So don't come crying to me.

and all I want is a chance,
but you can't make up your mind.

never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
- Erica please.

I was happy at the time,

[Bobby] Hold up, wait a minute,
I ain't afraid of commitment, but Yas is,
trust me, he'd be gone in an instant.
[Yas] Bobby's obsessive, he sleeps next to your pictures.
Now, let me go get Justin to cry you one more river.
- Cry me a river.
### big on pleasing but he acts like he mastered it.
I heard two minutes and he's sexually inadequate.
[Bobby] Okay, Yas, he's a loser, and I don't see the attraction,
all those pickup lines he uses, he read 'em in the last Maxim.
And ask him about how he likes to flirt with strangers.
He'd drop you in a second to watch the Indiana Pacers.
[Yas] Bobby, come on, you and Erica are dead wrong,
you'd have better luck hooking up with Stifler's Mom.
[Bobby] Listen, Erica's my soulmate, my fate, my world,
so get that through your head and go chase some other girl.
[Yas] Now Erica's my dream, my Billie Jean, my life.
Now is it him or is it me? You shouldn't have to think twice.
[Joss Stone]
I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
- Erica please.
I was happy at the time,
never knowing who was mine.
Now I hear your heart is broken.
[Yas] Yo, you need to - pay me a listen, and -uh- follow my vision,
and -uh- stop playing mind games and make a decision.
[Bobby] Listen up, Erica, this whole charade feels senseless.
Never knew a girl could come between friendships.
[Joss Stone]
I never meant for this to grow so far,
I'm waiting to find out who you are.
[Bobby] Erica the beautiful
[Yas] slash dangerous,
[Bobby] slash hateful, 
[Yas] slash painful,
[Bobby] she's my dark angel
[Yas] oh what a tangled web she weaves, 
[Bobby] truly mine, 
[Yas] truly yours,

I was happy at the time,

You wanna be a star, here's a gimmick and a style,
To mimmick and free clothes to help design your image.
I feel like the only way I'll see fame and wealth,
Is to kill myself the same week my record hits the shelf.
All you really need is a record label budget,
Then watch the machine force feed it to the public.
Hate it or love it, watch it or unplug it.
Careers disappear quicker than next week's club hit.
You're just a puppet on a string I'm your master.
You're not cut out to sing, you might as well be an actor.
Or write a chapter how sex sells music,
Nobody likes your songs, they watch your videos muted.
Mixed and diluted, polluted trashed will crash.

Overnight stars want credit? Forget it.
Yeah, you went platinum, but who bought your record?
Extra philosophy, behind a music prodigy.
The next best thing since The Motley Crue Biography.
It's like Gods become a shark in deep water.
You swim up to the mainstream, then you bite the author.
You could be a star, too, if you're near edges.

We're sick and all alone

We're rolling on the floor

We cut relationships with your friends 

We're gonna steal your mail

All you need is sonar and nerves of steel, so

Cross Nevada at a hundred-and-ten
Highway 50 and there's nobody there
Sign says, ""next sign thirty miles""

I'd rather cruise around all day than save up for a move 

Plow through rest area San-O-Lets
Splat, goes the lonely salesman
Wanking in the men's room 

Buzzbomb Buzzbomb, tape up loud
Blue piss clinging to my windshield
Faster, faster in my car 

Buzzbomb is my pride and joy, king of the trailer court
Waiting for the perfect chick, who'll love me for my car 

I tell her why I'm cool
She coos back, just what I like
When I pretend she's near 

Zip through Ely where Pat Nixon was born
The cops 'round here sure looking bored
Flashing sirens, state patrol

Stockpiled in the basement?
Be a hero and save it

She might still be inside

Your time card says your name's Joe
But we'll call you 6-3-0 

[Chorus]
I'm working at my job 
I'm so happy 
More boring by the day 
But they pay me 
All that time spent going to school
Just to end up following-rules 

[Chorus]

Now it's time to take a break
Don't stray too far or you'll be late
Thank you for your service and a long career
Glad you gave us your best years

"Another rainy morning mingling at the market
Bartering for food for another day
Rifle shots ring out behind the crumbling buildings
Executions have begun 

Sprawled in the square are today's broken bodies
Lots to pick clean if you're first and quick
Rift through their pockets, peel off their clothes
To wear or sell when you wash out the blood 

Run my little brother
Run to the chicken farm
Opportunity is calling
You might even find a watch 

We're going down
To the chicken farm 

Napalm rains no more
But the war goes on
Little brother died playing at the dump today
He found a new toy and held it up proud
Then it blew him to bits 

How many more children 
Will be killed or die at birth 
Deformed by Agent Orange 
In our food chain forever more 
We're going down 
To the chicken farm 
This time we'll buy our way out 
I've got a plan; you wait and see 
I smuggled you this map 
In the gash I sliced in my thigh 
I hope I'm there to join you, love 
We're blown to bits one by one in this camp 
We crawl shaking through the fields at gunpoint all day 
To defuse leftover landmines-by hand 
We shiver on the deck and stiffen for the worst
If the pirates come around we might as well be dead
We'll be thrown in the sea
Or butchered if we're women
All in the name of gold 
One foot in a land we can barely understand
Can't speak the tongue of Yankee hospitality
Our kids at school get beat up
To the tune of ""Boat people, go home"" 

Sliced with a machete
From the breast of our homeland
Our new world tries to spit us out
But it sure beats the chicken farm",5
"Happy hour belongs to America's best-loved thugs
Here comes the four-wheel prosthetic penises
Got yer gun racks, tractor tires and lynch mob drivers
We couldn't find a chick to sit in the middle
So we drink ourselves sick
Lean out the windows and pinch ass instead 

We are the Goons of Hazzard 
Glorified on your TV 
We run down bikes and hitch hikers 
And we know we'll get off scot-free 

We're the vigilante heroes of your tough-guy flicks
Bashing punks & bums and fags
With our baseball bats
No deer to blow away in the woods today

So we go to Oroville and shoot a black kid down
Or waste demonstrators in Greensboro instead 
We are the Goons of Hazzard 
Glorified on your TV 

We leave you in a pool of blood 
'Cause we know we'll get off scot-free 
Let's get him: 
Come here

Come here
Say something to me? 

We've got him cornered
We've got him cornered
Is anybody looking?
Does anybody even care?
No! 

Local papers paint us up to be big heroes
City fathers and Chamber of Commerce want us deputized
The stoner gestapo keepin' your town clean
Get a shave, kid
We'll pay you as a strike-breaker
Maybe you'll make Tac Squad for the L.A.P.D. 

We are the Goons of Hazzard 
Glorified on your TV 
We leave you in a pool of blood 
And we always get off scot-free",5
"In lonely gas stations with mini-marts
You'll find rows of them for sale
Liquor-filled statues of Elvis Presley
Drink like a vampire 
His disciples flock to such a fitting shrine
Sprawled across from his graceless mansion
A shopping mall
Filled with prayer rugs and Elvis dolls 

And I wonder
Yeah I wonder
Will Elvis take the place of Jesus in a thousand years 

Religious wars
Barbaric laws
Bloodshed worldwide
Over what's left of his myth 

A growing boy needs his lunch 

When pesticides get banned we're safe up north
We just sell them to those other countries
Soon there's lots of exotic deformed babies
Somehow that's not our fault 

Just dip 'em in glaze paint 'em orange and green
For the Arizona roadside stands
To sell alongside plaster burros and birthbaths 

And I wonder
Yeah I wonder
Why so many insects around us feed off the dead 

Death squads
Starvation
Foreign aid?
Just leave it to the magic of the marketplace 

A growing boy needs his lunch 

Everyone should just love each other 
Dip your toe into the fire 
Drop your guns and lawsuits and love each other 
Life begins beyond the bunker 
And while you're busy hugging in the streets
Outgrowing your hatred for all to feel
Jiminy Cricket's found a game to play
Stick your neck out and trust-It'll be chopped away 
Jimmy through your locked front doors
Rifle through your sacred drawers
Line my pockets
Deface your dreams
Til the cows come home to me 

Nibbling like an earwig winding through your brain
Bound like Lawrence Harvey spread eagle to a bed
The migraine gets worse when we find out we lay eggs
And no one in all of Borneo can hear you scream 

Turn on
Tune in
Cop out 

Drop kick 
Turn in 
Tune out",6
"Hellnation's when they teach us
Profiting from greed
Hellnation's what they give us
Coke, heroin & speed 

Hellnation's when they tell you
You gotta go clean up your act
You're the one who dragged me here
And now you drag me back 

To this Hellnation 

[Chorus]
Problem is, few care
About the people in despair
If you help no one
You're guilty in the Hellnation 

Hellnation's when the president
Asks for four more fucking years
Hellnation's when he gets it
By conning poor people and peers 

Hellnation-got no choice
What's the point of trying to vote?
When this country makes war
We all die in the same boat 

In this Hellnation 

[Chorus]

It's the only world we've got
Let's protect it while we can
It's all there is and there ain't no more 

Hellnation-asking please
For a nuclear freeze
So the unborn kids
Get their chance to live and breathe 

Hellnation asking aid
For the minimum wage
So the kids of tomorrow
Don't wind up slaves to their trade
In the Hellnation

"You really like gorillas?
We've got just the pet for you
It's the way you're forced to act

Make your whole life revolve around sports
Walk tough-don't act too smart
Be a mean machine
Then we'll let you get ahead 

Jock-O-Rama-Save my soul 
We're under the thumb of the Beef Patrol 
The future of America is in their hands 
Watch it roll over Niagara Falls 
Pep rally in the holy temple
And you're forced to go
Masturbate en masse
With the favored religious cult 
Cheerleaders yell-""Ra Ra Team""
From the locker room parades the prime beef
When archaeologists dig this up
They'll either laugh or cry 

Jock-O-Rama-On the brain 
Redneck-a-thon drivin' me insane 
The future of America is in their hands 
Watch it roll over Niagara Falls 
Unzip that old time religion
On the almighty football field
Beer bellies of all ages
Come to watch the gladiators bleed 
""Now boys, this game ain't played for fun
You're going out there to win
How d'ya win?
Get out there
And snap the other guy's knee!"" 

Beat 'em up! Beat 'em up!
Ra Ra Ra
Snap those spinal cords
Ha Ha Ha 

The star quarterback lies injured
Unconscious on the football field
Looks like his neck's been broken
Seems to happen somewhere every year 

His mom and dad clutch themselves and cry
Their favorite son will never walk again
Coach says, ""That boy gave a hundred percent
What spirit
What a man"" 

But who cares?
Games over-Let's go get wasted man
To the 7-11, to the liquor store
Let's party all night and party some more 

Another Trans-Am
Wrapped itself around a telephone pole
""I ain't drunk, officer
I just fell gettin' out of my car"" 

Don't worry about it, son
We were that way when we were young
You've got all the skills
To make a damn good businessman 

Jock-O-Rama-that's the law 
Come lick the butts of the Beef Patrol 
If the future of America is handed to them 
Watch it roll over Niagara Falls",5
"Fun Fun Fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb
Woof down the beer

Hi
I'm your video DJ
I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes
I wear a satin baseball jacket everywhere I go 

My job is to help destroy
What's left of your imagination
By feeding you endless doses
Of sugar-coated mindless garbage 

So don't create
Be sedate
Be a vegetable at home
And thwack on that dial
If we have our way even you will believe
This is the future of rock and roll 

How far will you go
How low will you stoop
To tranquilize our minds with your sugar-coated swill 

You've turned rock and roll rebellion
Into Pat Boone sedation
Making sure nothing's left to the imagination 

M.T.V. Get off the 
M.T.V. Get off the 
M.T.V. Get off the air
Get off the air 

See the latest rejects from the muppet show
Wag their tits and their dicks
As they lip-synch on screen 
There's something I don't like
About a band who always smiles
Another tax write-off
For some schmuck who doesn't care 

M.T.V. Get off the air 
And so it was
Our beloved corporate gods
Claimed they created rock video

Allowing it to sink as low in one year
As commercial TV has in 25 
""It's the new frontier,"" they say
It's wide open, anything can happen

But you've got a lot of nerve
To call yourself a pioneer
When you're too god-damn conservative
To take real chances. 

Tin-eared
Graph-paper brained accountants
Instead of music fans
Call all the shots at giant record companies now 

The lowest common denominator rules
Forget honesty
Forget creativity
The dumbest buy the mostest
That's the name of the game 

But sales are slumping
And no one will say why
Could it be they put out one too many lousy records?!? 

M.T.V.-Get off the air! 
NOW",5
"We're sorry
But you're no longer needed
Or wanted
Or even cared about here 
Machines can do a better job than you
This is what you get for asking questions 

The unions agree
'Sacrifices must be made'
Computers never go on strike
To save the working man you've got to put him out to pasture 

Looks like we'll have to let you go
Doesn't it feel fulfilling to know
That you-the human being-are now obsolete
And there's nothing in hell we'll let you do about it 

Soup is good food-(We don't need you any more) 
You made a good meal-(We don't need you any more) 
Now how do you feel-(We don't need you any more) 
To be shit out our ass 
And thrown in the cold like a piece of trash 
We're sorry
You'll just have to leave
Unemployment runs out after just six weeks 
How does it feel to be a budget cut?
You're snipped
You no longer exist 

Your number's been purged from our central computer
So we can rig the facts
And sweep you under the rug
See our chart? Unemployment's going down
If that ruins your life that's your problem 

Soup is Good Food, Etc. 
We're sorry
We hate to interrupt
But it's against the law to jump off this bridge 
You'll just have to kill yourself somewhere else
A tourist might see you
And we wouldn't want that 

I'm just doing my job, you know
So say uncle
And we'll take you to the mental health zoo
Force feed you mind-melting chemicals
Til even the outside world looks great 

In hi-tech science research labs
It costs too much to bury all the dead
The mutilated disease-injected
Surplus rats who can't be used anymore 

So they're dumped (with no minister present)
In a spiraling corkscrew dispose-all unit
Ground into sludge and flushed away
Aw geez 

Soup is good food 
You made a good meal, etc:. 
We know how much you'd like to die
We joke about it on our coffee breaks
But we're paid to force you to have a nice day
In the wonderful world we made just for you 
""Poor Rats"", we human rodents chuckle
At least we get a dignified cremation
At yet
At 6:00 tomorrow morning
It's time to get up and go to work",6
"Finally got to Washington in the middle of the night
I couldn't wait
I headed straight for the Capitol Mall
My heart began to pound
Yahoo! It really exists
The American International Pictures logo

I looked up at that Capitol Building
Couldn't help but wonder why
I felt like saying ""Hello, old friend""

Walked up the hill to touch it
Then I unzipped my pants
And pissed on it when nobody was looking

Like a great eternal Klansman
With his two flashing red eyes
Turn around he's always watching
The Washington monument pricks the sky
With flags like pubic hair ringed 'round the bottom

The symbols of our heritage
Lit up proudly in the night
Somehow fits to see the homeless people
Passed out on the lawn

So this is where it happens
The power games and bribes
All lobbying for a piece of ass

Of the stars and stripes of corruption
Makes me feel so ashamed
To be an American
When we're too stuck up to learn from our mistakes
Trying to start another Vietnam
Whilke fiddling while Rome burns at home
The Boss says, ""You're laid off. Blame the Japanese""
""America's back,"" alright
At the game it plays the worst
Strip mining the world like a slave plantation

No wonder others hate us
And the Hitlers we handpick
To bleed their people dry
For our evil empire

The drug we're fed
To make us like it
Is God and country with a band

People we know who should know better
Howl, ""America riles. Let's go to war!""
Business scams are what's worth dying for

Are the Soviets our worst enemy?
We're destroying ourselves instead
Who cares about our civil rights
As long as I get paid?

The blind Me-Generation
Doesn't care if life's a lie

So easily used, so proud to enforce

The stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down!
Tell me who's the real patriots
The Archie Bunker slobs waving flags?
Or the people with the guts to work
For some real change
Rednecks and bombs don't make us strong
We loot the world, yet we can't even feed ourselves
Our real test of strength is caring
Not the toys of war we sell the world
Just carry on, thankful to be farmed like worms
Old glory for a blanket
As you suck on your thumbs

Real freedom scares you
'Cause it means responsibility

So you chicken out and threaten me

Saying, ""Love it or leave it""
I'll get beat up if I criticize it
You say you'll fight to the death
To save your worthless flag

If you want a banana republic that bad
Why don't you go move to one
But what can just one of us do?
Against all that money and power
Trying to crush us into roaches?

We don't destroy society in a day
Until we change ourselves first
From the inside out

We can start by not lying so much
And treating other people like dirt
It's easy not to base our lives
On how much we can scam

And you know
It feels good to lift that monkey off our backs

I'm thankful I live in a place
Where I can say the things I do
Without being taken out and shot
So I'm on guard against the goons
Trying to take my rights away
We've got to rise above the need for cops and laws

Let kids learn communication
Instead of schools pushing competition
How about more art and theater instead of sports?

People will always do drugs
Let's legalize them
Crime drops when the mob can't price them
Budget's in the red?
Let's tax religion

No one will do it for us
We'll just have to fix ourselves
Honesty ain't all that hard
Just put Rambo back inside your pants
Causing trouble for the system is much more fun

Thank you for the toilet paper
But your flag is meaningless to me
Look around, we're all people
Who needs countries anyway?

Our land, I love it too
I think I love it more than you
I care enough to fight

The stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down!
If we don't try
If we just lie
If we can't find
A way to do it better than this
Who will?",5
"Step right up folks 

Anarchy for sale!
T-shirts only ten dollars
Badges only 3.50
I nicked the design, never asked the band
I never listen to them either

Another fast-food fad to throw away 

Get your anarchy for sale 
Anarchy for sale

"Poison is bubbling
Beneath your dreamhome
Buried there years before 

Kid runs in crying
From playing in the garden
""Mommy, I burned my hands!"" 

""What's making our eyes so itchy?""
""Don't rub 'em-they'll swell up."" 

Oh Oh Oh Oh 
It's the big waste dump
Oh, yeah 

We built your ticky-tacky houses
On landfill soil
To cover up a gift
We left you years before 

Of toxic chemicals
And leaking gas
Just dig a little while,
You'll find our acid baths 

Cesspools
In Eden
Oozing away: 

Groundwater's poisoned
Air stings like hell
The lines for doctors grow long 

Over martinis
The company laughs
""We don't owe you one damn thing."" 

But what about all these fainting spells?
How'd you like a lick
From my open sores 

And Oh:.Oh Oh Oh - 
Why are our babies stillborn? 

A storage tank's leaking
It's about to explode
Why evacuate
When you can watch the fun 

Nothing happens here
Get out the lawn chairs
We'll drink pink lemonade
And watch Martinez burn 

Cesspools
In Eden
Oozing away
Cesspools in Eden
Leak by the day 

The land we sold you
Is right atop our acid pits
We fill them by the truckload
In the dead of night 

There's thousands more toxic
Tips of the iceberg
We pay a little bribe
Or we just don't report them 

And see what you get-
Cesspools
In Eden
In Eden
No accident-
Just a little of our greed-fueled negligence 

So you've found the proof why
Your cancer rate's shot up
But whatcha gonna do
When we've got all the cards 

Times Beach, Rocky Flats,
Love Canal & Bhopal
Merry Christmas, hostages
From the folks who care 

Cesspools in Eden
Oozing away
Cesspools in Eden
Leak by the day
Cesspools in Eden
Have a nice day",5
"Punk's not dead
It just deserves to die
When it becomes another stale cartoon
A close-minded, self-centered social club
Ideas don't matter, it's who you know
If the music's gotten boring
It's because of the people
Who want everyone to sound the same
Who drive bright people out
Of our so-called scene
'Til all that's left Is just a meaningless fad
Hardcore formulas are dogshit
Change and caring are what's real
Is this a state of mind
Or just another label
The joy and hope of an alternative
Have become its own cliche
A hairstyle's not a lifestyle
Imagine Sid Vicious at 35
Who needs a scene
Scared to love and to feel
Judging everything
By loud fast rules appeal
Who played last night?
""I don't know, I forgot.
But diving off the stage Was a lot of fun.
[Chorus:]
So eager to please
Peer pressure decrees
So eager to please
Peer pressure decrees

Make the same old mistakes
Again and again,
Chickenshit conformist
Like your parents
What's ripped us apart even more than drugs
Are the thieves and the goddamn liars
Flipping people off when they share their stuff
When someone falls are there any friends?
Harder core than thou for a year or two
Then it's time to get a real job
Others stay home, it's no fun to go out
When the gigs are wrecked by gangs and thugs
When the thugs form bands, look who gets record deals
From New York metal labels looking to scam
Who sign the most racist queerbashing bands they can find
To make a buck revving kids up for war
Walk tall, act small
Only as tough as gang approval
Unity is bullshit
When it's under someone's fat boot
Where's the common cause
Too many factions
Safely sulk in their shells
Agree with us on everything
Or we won't help with anythng
That kind of attitude
Just makes a split grow wider
Guess who's laughing while the world explodes
When we're all crybabies
Who fight best among ouselves

[Chorus]
That farty old rock and roll attitude's back
""It's competition, man, we want to break big.""
Who needs friends when the money's good
That's right, the '70s are back.
Cock-rock metal's like a bad laxative
It just don't move me, ya know?
The music's OK when there's more ideas than solos
Do we rally need the attitude too?
Shedding thin skin too quickly
As a fan it disappoints me
Same old stupid sexist lyrics
Or is Satan all you can think of?
Crossover is just another word
For lack of ideas
Maybe what we need
Are more trolls under the bridge
Will the metalheads finally learn something-
Or will the punks throw away their education?
No one's ever the best
Once they believe their own press
""Maturing"" don't mean rehashing
Mistakes of the past

[Chorus]
The more things change
The more they stay the same
We can't grow
When we won't criticize ourselves
The '60s weren't all failure
It's the '70s that stunk
As the clock ticks we dig the same hole
Music scenes ain't real life
They won't get rid of the bomb
Won't eliminate rape
Or bring down the banks
Any kind of real change
Takes more time and work
Than changing channels on a TV set

Our chameleon tongues catch the flies in the air",6
"You look at me from the back of the room
All I see is a bumbling buffoon
Head down like you don't see much
Until you move in to make your bust 

I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me 

Disguised like you're one of the scene
Just stand alone with no real friends
Scared people will find out who you are
Alone in the world without your telephone beeper 

I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me 

Curious folks ask questions of life
But you can't answer 'cause your heart's like a knife
Still you feel you sing the last song sung
You're just a heartless piece of scum with a gun 

I spy for you and me
I spy for you and me
I spy I spy 
I spy",5
"We have reviewed your yellow form
Congratulations! we find you qualified
You have just the right capacity
For putting up with our nonsense
There's just one thing you've got to prove
We know how you must be dishonest and lazy
If you're so desperate
You actually want to work at this place

[Chorus]
You must be guilty (lie detector)
Guilty (lie detector)
Guilty (lie detector)
Guilty 'til you're proven innocent

These days
Blood pressure clamps around your arms
Now don't get nervous when we yell in your face
We know you steal- Just who do you screw?
With what?!
With who?!?
Aren't you a Christian?!?!?
The polygraph-don't make it move
One little twitch, the anvil drops on you
Don't matter if you told the truth
We want your facial egg for our file

[Chorus]

Guilty-'til proven innocent
Guilty-It says so on your face
Guilty-When you try to find a place to live or a job that pays
Guilty-Whe you file a complaint against the cop that kicked your face last night
Guilty-It says so on page three
Guilty-Who'd think a guy like me would plant drugs in your car
Break in your house while you're asleep
Open your mouth, bet your ass you're watched
And it's your word against ours
Yeah, just because we're hiring you
That don't mean we trust you at all
You'll have to take a test like this
Once or twice every week
We know machines, they make mistakes
Yeah, it's your word against our dead black box
The machine is always right
Cause we know how it makes you feel so small
Because you're guilty (lie detector)
'Til you're proven innocent these days
No one's innocent these days
Cause when you're innocent it just don't pay",5
"Name one thing on earth lower than a tough guy
Who talks with his fists instead of using his head
Who beats the shit out of anything it can't understand
Behind the muscle mask is a scared little boy 

[Chorus]
Called macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
Macho insecurity
Cause you can't stand 
Yourself 

Got a bitch with me?
Why won't you say it to my face?
It's so easy to mouth off to others
But where's your proof?
Maybe we can talk if you'd just drop your act
Nothing's ever solved by making childish threats
That's macho insecurity 

[Chorus]

Why do you want people to be so afraid of you?
Why are you so scared of anything that's different?
No one's ever there when you need friends
You wonder why:
It's 'cause you take yourself so seriously
But being such a clown
Gives the rest of us the right to laugh
At your macho insecurity
Cause you can't stand yourself",4
"Get ready for the blast off! 
And don't forget the hype! 
We're going into space. 

Distinguished scientists
A pesky senator
And monkey turds leaking from the lab
All brought to us play-by-play by Howard Cosell 

You're going where no man has gone before
Because we owe you some favors
And besides you're bright
A little too bright 

Step one:
Senator, your vomit,
It's time to analyze it
For the folks back home 

Open the hatch, launch the war satellite
That the commies aren't supposed to know about
Our real challenge is to keep it a secret
From the press back home 

You're going where no man has gone before
Don't ask us where that is-we have no idea 

You're chosen for this great mission
Because you're hearty and strong
And make a lot of fuss
Especially around us
We like you better when you're far away 

Have you noticed? 
You're gong the wrong direction 
We have,
But that's your problem 
We planned it that way
We had to dispose of all of you so
We can spoil the final frontier
How dare you question our Star Wars plans
For the farce that they are? 

You're going where no man has gone before
For rocking the boat
In our temple of doom 

You're on a one-way ticket to Pluto
We wash our hands
Of you and your lost ark

No no no no no 
No no no no no

Camera angle when lemmings balk at dying for disney they're just
Hurled off the cliff, we are gathered here today to take photos of the

From beirut gift wrapped in body bags, a truck bomb blew them to bits
We knew they were sitting ducks we sacrificed 'em, aztec style so we

"Got a deadly toy
To brainwash your boy 

An egocentric muscle thug
Kicks butt on screen like a brat out a hell
Bullshitter in the Indochina shop
Pull the string in his back, we win the war 

That we never should have started at all 

A cabbage patch terrorist to call our own
Who rewrites history with a machine gun
Don't think about it-kill it
That's what we teach your child 

Rambozo 
Rambozo 
Rambozo the clown 
To draft age kids
It sure looks like fun-
""kill 'em all
And let god sort 'em out.""

Just fuel for a mass lapse of common sense
You can be don Quixote
We'll dice you with our windmill blades 

Brawn over brain
Means a happy ending
G.i. Joe in the cereal bowl
Grey shrapnel-flavored chewing gum
Mass murder ain't just painless
Now we've made it cute

Rambozo the clown 
War is sexy
War is fun
Iron ego

Be a wolverine. you'll rule the hills
Just get some guns and cheerios

V.a. hospital, they don't care
""we're the machine
You're just a tool.""
Who fell for the myth of Rambozo the clown",6
"If only people could shrink
Our world wouldn't be so overcrowded
Bring ourselves down to size
There'd be so much more food to go 'round 

Why don't we build a machine
With all the know-how of the industries
We put a man on the moon
On earth we'll need more room to breathe real soon 
Oh 

Drink your vaccine and let's shrink
And bring your poodle so it doesn't eat us
The roads will be so wide
No traffic jams when we're half a foot tall 
Bring what you need down here
We'll shrink it all by microwave
Don't want to die like dinosaurs
We'll have enough resources to go round 

Oh 

So now you've made the big shrink
Meanwhile we'll keep acting big
We well-bred beautiful people
Who says we have to go too? 
Cops and Mason businessmen
Were exempted from the ovens
As if you weren't already.

Using music to put people's brains to sleep 

Ever wonder why commercial radio's so bad?

If the Doors or John Lennon were getting started now
The industry wouldn't sign 'em in a million years

"Seems like the more
I think I know
The more I find I don't
Every answer opens up so many questions anarchy sounds good to me
Then someone asks, ""Who'd fix the sewers?""
""Would the rednecks just play king
Of the neighborhood?""
How many liberators
Really want to be dictators
Every theory has its holes
When real life steps in
So how do we feed
And make room for
All the people crowded on our earth
And transfer all that wealth
From the rich to those who need it

Where do ya draw the line
Where do ya draw the line

I'm not telling you I'm asking you
Ever notice hard line radicals
Can go on start trips too
Where no one's pure and right
Except themselves ""I'm cleansed of the system.""
('Cept when my amp needs electric power)
Or-""The Party Line says no.
Feminists can't wear fishnets.""
You want to help stop war?
Well, we reject your application
You crack too many jokes
And you eat meat
What better way to turn people off
Than to twist ideas for change
Into one more church
That forgets we're all human beings
Where do ya draw the line?
In Toronto someone blew up
A cruise missile warhead plant
Ten slightly hurt, four million dollars damage
Why not destroy private property
When it's used against you and me
Is that violence
Or self-defense
You tell me

"Greetings:This is the Secretary of War at the State Department 
Of the United States
We have a problem. 
The companies want something done about this sluggish 

World economic situation
Profits have been running a little thin lately 
And we need to stimulate some growth
Now we know 

There's an alarmingly high number of young people roaming 
Around in your country with nothing to do but stir up trouble 
For the police and damage private property. 
It doesn't look like they'll ever get a job

It's about time we did something constructive with these people
We've got thousands of 'em here too. They're crawling all over
The companies think it's time we all sit down, have a serious get-together-
And start another war

The President? 
He loves the idea! All those missiles streaming overhead to and fro
Napalm
People running down the road, skin on fire

The Soviets seem up for it:
The Kremlin's been itching for the real thing for years. 
Hell, Afghanistan's no fun
So whadya say?

We don't even have to win this war. 
We just want to cut down on some of this excess population
Now look. Just start up a draft; draft as many of those people as you can. 
We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on, 

Hand 'em some speed, give 'em an hour or two to learn how to use 
An automatic rifle and send 'em on their way
Libya? El Salvador? How 'bout Northern Ireland? 
Or a ""moderately repressive regime"" in South America?

We'll just cook up a good Soviet threat story 
In the Middle East-we need that oil
We had Libya all ready to go and Colonel Khadafy's hit squad 
Didn't even show up. I tell ya

That man is unreliable. 
The Kremlin had their fingers on the button just like we did for that one
Now just think for a minute-We can make this war so big-so BIG
The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper

We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this right. 
Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls
Now don't worry about demonstrations-just pump up your drug supply.
So many people have hooked themselves on heroin 

And amphetamines since we took over, it's just like Vietnam. 
We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong. 
Kept the war functioning just fine

It's easy. 
We've got our college kids so interested in beer 
They don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again. 
Put a nuclear stockpile in their back yard, 

They wouldn't even know what it looked like
So how 'bout it? Look-War is money. 
The arms manufacturers tell me unless 
We get our bomb factories up to full production 

The whole economy is going to collapse
The Soviets are in the same boat. 
We all agree the time has come for the big one, so whadya say?!?
That's excellent. We knew you'd agree

The companies will be very pleased.",6

Each penny saved buys more escape from home

Tells me just what I like

Shred through Palm Springs across the golf course
Cops 'round here scratching their heads

They're shooting out my tires

"Ray's guitar broke. No, we won't play Rawhide, won't play anything. 
We'll play the theme from the Dinah Shore show. 
Who wants to be Dinah Shore? Who's alter-ego is Dinah Shore? 
Oh, his fists didn't go up so quickly this time. Yawn, yawn, yawn. 
Put those headphones on, it's be-bop time. 

I want to tell you a story about the last time I was in Portland. 
The night before we played at the Long Goodbye. 
I was walking on the street about 10:30 at night. 
A lot of people go to bed around here at 10:30 at night. 
And well, I was walking along when suddenly these jocks in this 
bright blue pickup drove up. It had KC lights, tractor tires, 
everything but the CB. It was a life-size Hot Wheels car for some dumb rich kid, 
right. Well, they drove up to me 
and they yelled what dumb rich kids usually yell, ""Hey, faggot,"" 
and showered me with some water. 
So, I stood there thinking, what a bunch of fuckheads and picked up a rock. 
Now, I waited, walked down about a block to 
where the Kentucky Fried Chicken is, on Burnside, 
and sure enough they drove around again. 
They said, ""Hey, faggot, where's the nearest McDonald's?"" I said, 
""I don't know"" and they squirted me again. 
So I threw the rock and put a nice-size dent in their giant Hot Wheels car. 
They screeched to a halt in the parking lot of some department store, 
who's name I don't remember, it's up the street from Fred Meyer, 
and they got out their clubs and they ran after me, yelling, 
""We're gonna kill you, you god damn faggot, we're gonna kill you, 
you motherfucker."" 
So I got in a phone booth by the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Burnside, 
held my legs straight out like this so they couldn't open the door 
to the phone booth. So they began charging the phone booth, 
beating on it with their club, yelling, 
""We're gonna kill you, you motherfucker, we're gonna kill you, 
you god damn faggot."" I just looked at them. 
So, there was a crowd gathering by this time 
and these kids were standing nearby and they said, 
""Oh, look at him, he's insane."" I thought, ah-hah, here's my way out. 
I yelled at them, ""Take me to a mental hospital right away. 
I want to be be put away. 
Please put me away, c'mon, call the cops and put me away. 
Please put me away now."" 
They said, ""Alright, faggot, we're calling the police."" So they called the police. 
The cop comes out and I go, ah, my savior, I'm away from these jocks. 
He opens up the door, ""Get out of there, you,"" 
throws me up against the car, frisks me, shoves me in the back. 
Then he goes over to the jocks, ""Now what happened here? 
It looks like we're going have to take him to jail 
but we got to have the full story first"" 
So the jocks, who had an ace in the hole, ace in the hole 
Take down on the bass, a little bit down on the bass. Yeah, 
ace in the hole, and they go, ""Well, goddammit, 
the motherfucker put a dent in my truck, a $5000 truck, right, 
so I got my club, I went out and I wanted to kill him. 
I want to kill him. Let me kill him, goddammit. 
Let me kill him."" 
So the cop made them go home, and he drove me home, 
and he confiscated their club and my rock as further evidence. 
And I thought, so this is Oregon, huh? Tolerant Oregon? 

Ray, are you done with your guitar yet? He isn't done yet. 
So what else do you want to hear, I'm out of stories. 
That's a true story, too. Just ask Bruce Loose",5
"Tonight's the night that we got the truck
We're going downtown, gonna beat up drunks
Your turn to drive, I'll bring the beer
It's an easy shift, no one to fear

Let's ride, low ride

It's roundup time where the good whores meet
We're gonna drag one screaming off the street

Probably:
Right

You walk a little faster
Someone's following you 

The wallet-size bulge
In your double-knit butt

You can't look around
Quick now, fish for the keys for the door
You don't even know where you are

I'll play my music slow
I ain't no artist, I'm a business man

My Payola!
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola! 

You'll pay ten bucks to see me
On a fifteen foot high stage
Fatass bouncers kick the shit
Out of kids who try to dance 

If my friends say
I've lost my guts
I'll laugh and say 
That's rock and roll 

But there's just one problem

Is my cock big enough
Is my brain small enough
For you to make me a star
Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far 

And when I'm rich
And meet Bob Hope
We'll shoot some golf
And shoot some dope 

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?

[Chorus]",5
"There's a prefab building and a funny smell
Around the hill outside of town
Every now and then we wonder
But we shrug our shoulders
And get back to work

There's a railroad there and trains go by
And there's people locked in cattle cars
And have you noticed
The french fries at the A&W
Taste a little strange? 

I drive down to the disco
Pompadour and pink lamme
I bow and blow the doorman
He parts the chain, says join the game 

A quick line in the girls room
To the bar for the electrodes
A coin into the right slits
Tape my temple watch me go 

Now I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Slip my fingers down your Barbie-doll dress
Up and down your spandex ass 

If I lit a match for you 
You'd melt before my eyes
come here my pretty glow-worm
You look so fine to dance with me 

The fly-eye lights are throbbin'
I'm burning up the floor
Whirling twirling
Close my eyes
No faces judging me 

But I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Slip my fingers down your Barbie-doll dress
Up and down your spandex ass 

A Hitler youth in jogging suit
Smiling face banded 'round his arm
Says, 'Line up, you've got work to do
We need dog food for the poor' 

A scream bleats out, we're herded into lines
Customized vans wait outside
I'm getting scared of my new home
To Auschwitz condominiums we go
Oh no 

Now I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Let my fingers down your dress
One more time",6
"[Repeat: 13]
I like short songs",5
"Sixteen, on the honor roll
I wish that I was dead
Parents hate me, I got zits
And bruises 'round my head 

Pressure's on to get good grades
So I can be like them
Do my homework all the time
I can't go out just then 

People they ain't friends at all
They tease and suck me dry
Yell at me when I fuck up
And party while I cry
I look so big on paper
I feel so fucking small
Want to die and you don't care
Just stride on down the hall 

Suicide suicide
Read the paper, wonder why
Turn the light out, then you cry
It's your fault, you made me die 

Touch me won't you touch me now
So frozen I can't love
When I was born my mama cried
And picked me up with gloves 

Girls, they kick me in the eye
Want answers to the tests
When they get them they drive off
And leave me home to rest 

Hold my head
Make me warm
Tell me I am loved
Give me hope
Let me cry
Make me feel
Give me touch 

The window's broken bleeding screaming
Lying in the hall
I'm gone no one remembers me
A picture on the wall
""He was such a bright boy
The future in his hands:""
Or a spineless human pinball
Shot around by your demands 

Suicide suicide
Goin' to sleep and when I die
You'll look up and realize
Then look down and wipe your eyes
Then go back to your stupid lives
Aw shit",5
"Went to a party
I danced all night
I drank sixteen beers
And I started up a fight 

But now I am jaded 
You're out of luck
I'm rolling down the stairs
Too drunk to fuck 

I'm too drunk to fuck
You're too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
I'm too drunk, too drunk, too drunk
To fuck 

I like your stories
I love your gun
Shooting out truck tires
Sounds like loads and loads of fun 

But in my room
Wish you were dead
You bawl like a baby
In Eraserhead 

Too drunk to fuck
I'm too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
It's all I need right now
Too drunk to fuck 

I'm too drunk to fuck
You're too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
I'm sick soft gooey and cold 
Too drunk to fuck 

I'm about to drop
My head's a mess
The only salvation is 
I'll never see you again 

You give me head
It makes it worse
Take out your fuckin' retainer
Put it in your purse 

I'm too drunk to fuck
You're to drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
It's all I need right now oh baby
I'm melting like an ice cream bar
Oh baby 

And now I got diarrhea
Too drunk to fuck
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh",3

Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore 'cause you spike your hair

Fuck Off!

Nazi punks

Fuck Off!

If you've come to fight, get outta here
You ain't no better than the bouncers
We ain't trying to be police
When you ape the cops it ain't anarchy

Ten guys jump one, what a man
You fight each other, the police state wins
Stab your backs when you trash our halls
Trash a bank if you've got real balls

You still think swastikas look cool
The real Nazis run your schools
They're coaches, businessmen and cops
In a real fourth Reich you'll be the first to go

You'll be the first to go

I hate what I've become now
I hate that we compromised
Just to grow closer
Say that you're gonna go
See I can't take it anymore
I just can't find a way
I won't lie

One step away from here
and just a moment to go

Is it ok if I close my eyes
As we go further

I want escape from the compromise
As we come closer
Say that you're gonna go
See I can't take it anymore
This is my escape
One more lie

One step away from here
and just a moment to go

It's just a moment
One step away...

Just can't find a way",4
"You can feel it in the space around you
It's like there's something in the way
That you can't find
And you can't hide
You're only thinking it a day at a time
Somehow you've got to make a change and make it right
So I will try and let you walk away

Stop holding it down
Stop thinking it over
Decide and you'll live your life awake
Your body's the seeker
Emotion will lead you
Provided you live your life awake

I know you feel it in the space around you
It's coming round to make a change for you this time
So you can't hide
You're only thinking this a day at a time
You've only ever walked away so make it right.
I still try and let you walk away

Stop holding it down
Stop thinking it over
Decide and you'll live your life awake
Your body's a seeker
Emotion will lead you
Provided you live your life awake
It's all been in my head
So why don't you live your life today

Suffer reaction
Will you react to me
Over reaction

Got this whole thing underground
I can feel you in every sound
Got your face held up in lights
I see your hand in every little thing
See your mind in every little thing
Your face in line
Not every little thing will go your way

Stop holding it down
Stop thinking it over
Decide and you'll live your life awake
Your body's a seeker
Emotion will lead you
Provided you live your life awake
It's all been in my head
So why don't you live your life today

Suffer reaction
Will you react to me
Over reaction

If I could I would not react to you
If I could I would have no reaction.",5

I tell myself it's a question
The brighter days seem more
COloured by a perception
You go your way
And I'll go my way
And we've won

It's not worth it
It it's not perfect
And we are not.
For you I can change

I don't know why I tell myself
There's a reason
THe brighter days seem so long ago
Like a re-run

New direction
A new perception
A new day
For you I can change

How can we both be wrong
Caught in a moment
Will we find our way
SOmething we can't control
Back where we were before
Are we just holding on
To find ourselves
And someday we're back
Where we were before

Or are we holding on
To find our way
But somehow we're back
Where we were
Now we're back where we were
You holding
I am holding on
I can change
For you I can change
I Will

I don't know when
The day will come
So prepare yourself
I will walk away
Too fast to walk away",5
"Take me instead
I'll stand in the middle
A martyr once said
Hoping to deliver us

Take me instead
I'll stand in the middle
When the river runs red
Hoping for deliverance
Defiant, I'll become the shelter 
In the hope that my death 
Gives more before oblivion

I'm hoping that the river runs dry yet

I am all of who I am
Wear the face of all I know I am
I am all of who I am
I the tested, I the broken stand

Take me instead
I'll stand unforgiven
When the river runs red
Hoping this delivers us
Defiant, I'll become the shelter 
In the hope that my death 
Gives more before oblivion
Hoping that the river runs dry yet

I am all of who I am
Wear the face of all I know I am
I am all of who I am
I the tested, I the broken stand
On the inside

Born a slave here in denial I am free now
I am just holding my own sacred line
I will keep on following
For the one who bears the eyes I conceived
Mine offered up 
I will brace, bleed and defy 
The moment that the river runs

I am all of who I am
Wear the face of all I know I am
Both the liar and the honest man
I the tested, I the broken stand

I'm hoping to deliver us
Hoping to deliver us
Hoping that the river runs dry",5
"Like a lamb to its slaughter
Buried in water

Down
Under the ground
There's a town there
I've been down there
In the middle of the lake
I hold your hand, for goodness' sake

When the women and the kids are asleep
The walls there
And the skin of the sheep
So lock all the windows and doors
The Devil's coming for you and yours

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live 
They don't bury bodies from the drowned
But they drowned our little town

Like a lamb to his slaughter
Buried in water
Buried in water

Buried in water

When the leaves
Go floating away
In the pale moonlight of day
Iury anchors in our ghosts
And we can let our heartbeats go

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live 
They don't bury bodies from the drowned
But they drowned our little town

Love was all that it could give
But it died so other towns could live 
They don't bury bodies from the drowned
But they drowned our little town

We're like the lambs to its slaughter
Buried in water
Buried in water
Buried in water",5

"You'd look nice in a grave
I smile at the moon, death is on my face
And if you wait too long
Then you'll never see the dawn again

My skull is full of sunken ships
My heart's a prisoner to my ribs
We're flesh and bone when we're all alone
But together, forever, we'll live

There's gold in my heart
But the winds took my sails through the dark
And if you wait too long
then you'll never see the dawn again

He filled my heart, I did my best
But without the sun, I'm only shadows in a dress
'Cause if the full moon comes, our love is done
So forever, towards dawn, we run",6
"If the lady of the morning light
Should open her eyes
She'd bid the sun arise

Our eyes adjust to the sun's bright rays
But here comes the sky",7

And the great owl flying through the night sky

The great oak, the lonely seer
Dressed like a druid

You'd think a message
Might ring clear

The way it comes the way it goes
If I could see what's given to me
I might not forget so easily

I don't know but I believe
The endless surging of the sea
It's in every breath she breathes
But I don't always see too clearly

Yes, I know
I just can't say the river flows
I'm in the way, the sun's not set

It's not night yet
The water glows purple and blue
Yes, it shows I love you too

"Bad blood stirring in the boiling pot
Finger on the trigger of a gun
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
It's an old web being spun
Born from the seeds of anger and hatred
Do it to them like they do
It's only revenge and the worst of it all
It all comes back to you

Envy treads at the breaking edge
Where dogs begin to wail
Sorrow imprisoned the widows eyes
Like arrows too, they fell
Trying to balance the scales of injustice
Do it to them like they do
It's only revenge and the worst of it all
It all comes back to you

The hounds pursue the weary step
As silver etched the sent
Chasing down the passions of mans convictions
Escaping time he'd never spent
Half starved and running
He'll pay for his blindness
Racing the bullets of hate
Thirteen steps an a dead mans walk
It's always been this way
It all comes back to you",3
"Stranded in the storm trying to see through the rain
Looks like my life's coming 'round again
I wouldn't stop it now even if I thought I could
I was one of the remnants from a burned out scene
Trying to recover from the years between
What they didn't want then is what they think they want now

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

I'd been pickin' up the pieces from another hard fall
Waitin' by the phone for an overseas call
They wanted my past and they wanted it now
I could sense it in the air, feel it in my veins
Something was coming to take me away
I'd been lost for so long, maybe it's the price we all pay

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago

I looked in the mirror trying to see
What it was they had killed in me
And why can't I no longer believe
I wandered around and I swore by God
I would never give in no matter how hard they fought
I've waited too long to have it any other way

Down the road, down the road
I can still remember being here a long time ago",4
"Well I tried everything
Just to get along with you
And I'm gonna tell you just
What I'm gonna do

You pack me bags, I'm gone

When your ol man ain't around

And tiara's by the score

Not in knights bridge anymore

We've seen them come and go
There's been so many i know
We used to feel like that a long, long time ago
We ain't really so different
We're all walking the line
And baby, we too are running out of time

We ain't the first to be braced
And we won't be the last

"The last train is leaving, can't you read the signals in my eyes?
I'm standing on the platform waiting for the one they left behind
If I'd foreseen the future, could I or would I have changed a thing?
Down a million miles of empty track just trying to get beyond what people think
And I don't know where I'm at

I'm heading down the hallway trying to find that doorway lost in time
I'd been here once before but through the years it slowly left my mind
I know your out there somewhere , waiting for me just beyond the rise
And if I ever find my way back to you- this time I'll realize
I don't know where I'm at

Imprisoned in a window, passengers looking down the line
I wonder what they're thinking, I wonder what they'll find
As I lit another cigarette watching for the wind across your hair
And for that fleeting moment, I swear, I saw you standing there
And I don't know where I'm at",5

How you can turn a crowd and still care who I am

I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return
I used to press my eyes into the looking glass
It always seemed to see the future from the past
Your only halfway there before you realize
You need to take a look into this strangers eyes
[chorus] 
I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return
Within a race for courage the clouds were breaking down
We left nothing behind and nowhere to turn around
I had to hold you close just to make it through the night
And we closed our eyes to all the things that might

I'll walk the fire with you 'till the point of no return",5

Fill all the empty spaces that you're falling through
Hold you up when your skies turn gray
Stand by you no matter what they say
You've done the same for me, I'll do the same for you

I'm takin' a chance and I don't know why
Can't do it alone 

I want to know your dreams
The roads that you've traveled and what you've seen
All the good and all the bad
What makes you smile, what makes you sad
Just let me in I'll open up to you

I'm takin' a chance and I don't know why
Can't do it alone

I want to rescue you
Make up for everything that's ever hurt you
Be a family and a world in two
Find your course I will follow you

"I tried to tell you that there's always two sides to the blade 
I saw my future cave in from the roots of decay 
The dark cloud started dancing all over the sun 
Whatever it took to make my blood run 

I had a ways to go 
Sorrow that you'll never know 
But lately it's beginning to show 
And I tell myself never again 

The armies of doubt were playing war in my head 
I couldn't recover from the things that they said 
Crash landed in the safehouse under the stairs 
Last place on earth where anyone cares 

Never dreamed I'd fall to this 
Something that I couldn't resist 
And now I just clench my fists 
And I tell myself never again 

Run silent, run deep, run as fast as you can 
Let the rest of the world slide through your hands 
Old habits die hard like a fatal disease 
They cut you so deep, you can never come clean 

I've got a past to pay 
I got demons to face 
I can't just run away 
But I tell myself never again",5
"Is anybody really free, prisoners of
The strange society
Why is it we're forced to be products
Of the new reality
Drifting through time and space
And all the while
Feeling out of place
I'm out of reach
Waiting for the time to come
And every second always on the run
Looking for love once more
Then turning back and closing every door
Thinking that what might have been
Had that itch not gotten 'neath your skin

Praying to an idol sign
Believing this can keep your dream alive
Worried 'bout the waste of youth
Hoping that with age there will come truth
Dying to get out in time
Before the shadows start to cloud your mind

Told I ain't enough
Done a lot of hard livin' in a world that's sometimes cold

Somehow I disconnected along that road
But try as I may
I can never be the same
This time I'm here to stay
Ricochet

Seen the walking side of death
The eyes that never rest
Been waiting in a line for the call that never comes
But kid, don't hold your breath
You're only second best
Ain't personal just business being done

With a paralyzing gaze
I walked onto the stage
Could I really be the outcast coming home
As I turn to look at you
The way you've fallen too
I hope I can take it when it goes",5
"Day after day we threw our cares away
Waiting for tomorrow, never living for today
We lined up in the trenches, holding higher ground
We looked away for answers but nothing could be found

And i swear, we won't keep standing still
Here to take your heat
The rain's about to fall
We're taking to the streets

Day after day nothing ever changed
Was it any wonder we all began to stray
Some of us for money, some of us for fame
Our goals were so impossible no one could take aim

Day after day the hours wore away
Regretting what we'd missed, closer to the grave
We're the broken generation, we don't know who we are
Fought for every losing cause and now we hide the scars",4

It's rollin 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since

And time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a movin' on
Down to San Antone

When I was just a baby
My mama said ""hey son,
Always be a good boy,
Don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno
Just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin'
I hang my head and cry

Well, if they freed me fom this prison
If that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it all
A little farther down the line
Far from folsom prison
That's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle
Blow my blues away",5

I was in the crowded season
When the leaves began to fall
I was in the mainline then
You were up against the wall
I couldn't see the end was near
You told me what I wanted to hear
It was easy to pretend
Remember me

And as I walked away
The changes that I saw
At once I was sure you'd made it
Just to see me crawl
And I remember you

Sooner or later I swear
I'll be taken on that long hard ride
Down to those sunset towers
Where you can hear lost angels cry
Falling like fire and rain
Back to my seeds again

Is a bit passe'
I hear you like to try it
So I'll try it anyway

I would try anything
I swear I'd try it here and now
I might impress you

I tell you to get your attention
I'd do anything
I would work night and day
For all the joy that she could bring

I'd like to be the hunter
Who get's captured by the game

A treasure chest of pretty things

I would buy you ten real diamond rings

Oh let me tell you
I got lots of things that you could use
So don't reject it or I'll get
The love rejection blues

Any wish of yours is my command
I'd pay you money
If you'd only say you'd hold my hand
I'd speak in languages

that only you could ever hear
Oh baby, take me
Won't you please come here!?

I said I'd pay you money
If you'd only hold my hand
I hear you like to try it

I hear my smoochie talkin'
Might just be a bit old hat
So I'll watch what I'm sayin'
I don't think you'd go for that

That you just might feel the same
If you do then all you have to do
Is call my name

"Yeah you know, we always tryin to get this money, that's what we do
It ain't easy but I'm tellin you, it ain't hard either
All you gotta do is keep hustlin man, don't ever give up
I don't care what it is, handle yo' biz
Forget about the woulda, coulda, and if I did's
Cause that's just the past, you know it never lasts
And you know how time flies by so fast
Look at rap music, they said it was a fad
But now it's takin' over, and I'm so glad
Cause I never stopped rappin', but that's what I do
If you quit yo' thang, you might never find the truth
I had choices in life, I coulda' did somethin' else
I did what I wanted to, I did it for myself
Now whatcha gon' do with yo' life
People try to tell you what to do, it's yo' life
You better make the most of it, live to the fullest
Think positive and don't dwell on the BULLSHIT
I can't tell you no better
If you thinkin' 'bout quittin', don't ever

Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin'
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't

Comin' up is hard, givin' up is easy
You always get the game from your homey Too Sheezy
I keep it so real, never spit it false
I hope you make it big and if you ever fall off
Remember these words, it's only what you make it
Anything is possible you want it better take it
I ain't talkin' 'bout stealin', felonies'll ruin it
Stupid all I'm talkin' 'bout is takin' opportunities
Doors open up and when you get another chance
Either hold up the wall, or get out there and dance
It's on you, do what you wanna do
You know why everybody always punkin' you
Talkin' shit they know you're bluffin', won't do nothin'
Sittin' on the shelf like Stove Top Stuffin'
I know you had enough and want to call it quits
Believe me, this ain't it

Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin'
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't

Isn't hard to see, use your eyes
It's time to tell the truth, cause we through witcha lies
Utilize all your steppin' stones, gotta be prepared
Sittin' 'round dreamin' how you bout to be a player
The years and the time fly, you ain't even workin'
Went by overnight you went from 18 to 30
Nothin' goin' on, never set a goal
Dreams can't come true, and now you gettin' old
You start to represent, everything you hate
But don't give up, cause it's never too late
All you need is a plan, a purpose and a motto
And quit livin' life like you 'bout to hit the lotto
Get rich on your own, buy a new home
Keep your real friends, leave them haters alone
I see you when you get there, rollin' to the bank
I know you cain't let go, I know you cain't

Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin'
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin'
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin'
You already knowin', you can't give up, you just cain't

Nah we can't give up, gotta keep hustlin' for life baby

"Turn up your radio now
I'm calling out your name

Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it

So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby

When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again, I want you back

We've both been acting strangely
And you can hardly face me
And I can see no fire in your eyes
We both know the answer
But one of us won't say it
Love's the only game in town
You sure know how to play it

The future of our love is on the line
The both of us could lose more than we find

So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby

When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again, I want you back

And if we think about it and come to the conclusion
That I want you, and you want me, we've come to the solution
And I cannot deny it, you were my perfect lover
If paradise is half as nice, I'd never find another

And now it's time, for making up your mind
The future is ahead don't look behind

So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby

When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again

I want your love in my hands where I can feel it
Love in my heart, where I can keep it warm
Turn up your radio now
I'm calling out your name

Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it

The love we've got cannot be left behind
It's time for you to tell me that you're mine

So turn around and count to ten
Before you lose the only one who really loves you
Somebody who likes you just as you are
Now how you might have been, oh baby

When you turn around again
I might be with someone else who really loves me
And now I'll say, what I don't want to say
I'll have you back again

I want you back in my life where I can hold you
Back in my dreams, where I can keep you warm
Here on my lips where I can
Taste your candy kiss",6

"Help me
You want me to help you?
Man is evil, capable of nothing but destruction

Once upon a time
There was a very serious situation growing
There was a farmer and a farmyard filled with animals
And this is the story of their times

Old man Sammy had a farm
Walked the land with the rifle
Most of the time shit was calm
His whole life was maintained off the everyday labor

From the mules in the field to the cattle in the stable
This is how we kept food on this table
(Maxing)
You would have he was disabled by the way he be relaxing
Acting like Mr. Magnificent

But the animals were thinking something different
The sentiment was tension in the barnyard
Throughout the years they had been through mad drama
With the farmer, word is bond

And they all came to one conclusion
They argued there was no way they'd ever be free
If it was up to humans
Therefore the only course left was revolution
Which was understandable

And since the pigs promised to lead in the interest of all the animals
They planned a full attack under the leadership of Hannibal
The fattest pig in the pack
The next morning on the farm, everything was calm

Just before dawn but before long
The sun got so hot it made the farm seem electric
Now check it this is when that shit got hectic
Directed by Hannibal, the animals attacked

Old Sam was in a state of shock and fell up on his back
And dropped his rifle reaching in vain
Each and every creature from the field at his throat
Screaming, ""Kill, feel the pain""

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

After they ran the farmer off the farm
The pigs went around and called a meeting in the barn
Hannibal spoke for several hours
But when talks about his plans for power

That's when the conversation turned sour
He issued an official ordinance to set
If not a pig from this day forth then you insubordinate
That's when the horses went buck wild

One of them shouted out
""You fraudulent pigs, we know your fucking style""
Hannibal's face was flushed and pale
All the animals eyes full of disgust and betrayal

He felt the same way Sam felt
They took his tongue out of his mouth
And cut his body up for sale, for real
You better listen while you can

It's a very thin line between animal and man
When Hannibal crossed the line they all took a stand
What would have done? Shook his hand?
This is the animal in man

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

This is the animal in man
This is the animal in you
This is the animal in man
Coming true

"Our people are poor, and you know damn well nobody wants to be poor
This play is gonna show how the pigs react when the people start
To take community, control over what belongs to them
And liberate it back (echoes)

Sometimes I just don't care

Murderation, modern hanging education
Price of your life is goin' up it ain't inflation
Incrimination, they got my picture at the station
Elimination, state to state we eatin' by this nation
Them belly full, my trigger finger got pulled
To cut the bull shots'll warm your flesh like wool
These tools for survival make fools out of rivals
Fuck the Bible, get on your knees and praise my rifle
Your life is done there ain't another place to run
Eat your own gun, scared because my people never known fun

Cops drive down the streets and blow my friends away
I try to smoke enough lah to take my sins away
This E and J be freein' us in it's own special way son
We live for the day, the only way done
The violence in me, reflect the violence that surround me
I choose that wildly Mr. Charley keep his eye on me
To figure my head, but them ass kissin' niggas is dead
We learn the choke holds with fishermen's thread
I read The Art of Sun-Tzu in a couple of fuckin' days
Used to practice Kung-Fu with this nigga that's like, double my age
And you can put this on the government's grave
Somebody payin' for the way we have to suffer and slave
Assassination, word up

I hope they get the assassins, I hope that something is done to them
Problem is they're killing them, it reminds me of something like what
Happened to Lincoln

You ain't even safe wit a full clip
Hustle out on the president's grave
I'm sick of livin' in this bullshit
We down to take it to the full length
Meet us up on Capitol Hill, and we can get up in some real shit

You ain't even safe wit a full clip

"It's all love

curried falafel, barbecued tofu

only ganja and fresh-squeezed juice from oranges
exercising daily to stay healthy
and I rarely drink water out the tap, cause it's filthy

Lentil soup is mental fruit
and ginger root is good for the yout'
Fresh veg-e-table with the mayatl stew
sweet yam fries with the green calalloo
careful how you season and prepare your foods

life brings life, it's valuable, so I eat what comes
from the ground, it's natural
let your food be your medicine (uh huh)
no Excederin (uh uh)
strictly herb, generate in the sun, cause I got melanin
and drink water, eight glasses a day

They say you are what you eat, so I strive to be healthy
my goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy

Walks just like Jim, talks just like him

Eighteen years, because the five-oh said so
They said he set a fire to an Arab store

Grand momma had to raise the baby
Just a young boy, born to a life of poverty
Hustlin', robbery, whatever brung the paper home
Carried the chrome like a blind man holdin' cane
Tattoos all over his chest, so you can know his name

Slip on a fatigues, grab a dutch and roll some indo

Sometime, I feel the same way, roll up a j, and get away
Put some food on the grill
And just chill
Maybe build with my elders (uh)
Never know the things they could tell ya
Learnin' why the caged bird sings (why it do that?)
'Cuz it's the vital things you know that separate the men from the Kings
The flowers that bloom and the Sun (uh)
And everybody singin' the tune, 'cuz it's time to have fun
We out, rollerbladin' (uh, uh), a day where no one coulda stayed inside
Wash the car, now it's time to take a ride
Me and my crew hangin' out, all night to sunrise
Celebration of life, 'cuz every day is a surprise
Think of the rich countryside on the land of Jamaica
Mountains, springs and green acres
Or any other place in the world your mind takes you
It's the good times in life that everybody can relate to (uh)
And you can leave your troubles behind
And have a wonderful time
Lay back and just ease your mind (whut)

White folks say it controls yo' brain
I know better than that, that's game
And we ready for that two soldiers head of the pack
Matter of fact, who got the Gat and where my army at?
Rather attack and not react
Back to beats, it don't reflect on how many records get sold
On sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll
Whether your project's put on hold
In the real world; these just people with ideas
They just like me and you when the smoke and camera disappear
Against the real world (against the real world)
It's bigger than all these fake-ass records
When po' folks got the millions and my woman's disrespected
If you check 1-2, my word of advice to you is just relax
Just do what you got to do, if that don't work, then kick the facts
If you a fighter, rider, biter, flame-ignitor, crowd-exciter
Or you want to just get high, then just say it
But then if you a liar-liar, pants on fire, wolf-crier, agent wit' a wire

You can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke
You would rather have a Lexus or justice, a dream or some substance?
A Beamer, a necklace, or freedom
Still a nigga like me don't playa-hate, I just stay awake
This real hip-hop and it don't stop
'Til we get the po-po off the block, they call it

Hip hop
It's bigger than hip hop

D.P.'s got that crazy shit
We keep it crunk-up, John Blazed and shit
D.P.'s got that crazy shit
We keep it crunk-up, John Blazed and shit
D.P.'s got that crazy shit
We keep it crunk-up, John Blazed and shit
D.P.'s got that crazy shit
We keep it crunk-up, John Blazed and shit
D.P.'s got that crazy shit
We keep it crunk-up",5
"It's still bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop hip
It's bigger than hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop

One thing 'bout music when it's real they get scared
Got us slavin' for the welfare
Ain't no food, clothes, or healthcare
I'm down for guerilla warfare
All my niggas put your guns in the air if you really don't care
Skunk in the air, make a nigga wanna buck in the air
For my brother locked up in the jump for a year
Shit is real out here don't believe these videos
This fake ass industry gotta pay to get a song on the radio
Really though, DP's gon' let you know
It's just a game of pimps and hoes
And it's all 'bout who you know
Not who we are, or how we grow
I rap 'bout what I know, what I go through
What I been through, not just for no dough
Even though the rent due, what I'm into ain't for no dough
Or just no fame, everything must change, nothin' remains the same
Sick of the same ol' thang, it's bigger than bling bling

If I, feel it I feel it, if I don't, I don't
If it ain't really real then I probably won't
Rollin' with my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die
Uh, hip what hop what hip what hop what hip what hop what hip what
Hop c'mon, c'mon, my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die

Hip-hop means sayin' what I want, never bite my tongue
Hip-hop means teachin' the young
If you feelin' what I'm feelin' then you hearin' what I'm sayin'
Cause these fake fake records just keep on playin'
What you sayin huh DP bringin' the funk
Let the bass-line rattle your trunk, uh
Punk pig wit a badge wanna handcuff me cause my pants that's tend to sag
Hip-hop means throw up your rag, soldier flag
Whether ridin on the bus or you stole a jag
M-1 mean freedom, burn the cash
Revolutionary love til the day we pass
Will they play it on the radio
Maybe not, maybe so we gon keep it pumpin' though
Everybody know we headed for the whoa, fo sho

Ay dogg that label is that slave ship
Owners got them whips and rappers is slaves
If you really wanna eat you gotta hear the same thing
With the football, b-ball, or if you slangin that dope
Ain't never seen no hope, brainwash video shows be foolin my folk
What the hell a brother gon do though, huh
When the rent due, when the lights and the gas gonna get cut off
Drop them raps or cock them gats
Ain't never had shit ever since we came to this bitch
Why I gotta feel pain to get rich
'Stead of stackin' chips, finna pack them clips

If I, feel it I feel it, if I don't, I don't
If it ain't really real then I probably won't
Rollin' with my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride
For this real hip hop y'all I'm ready to die
Uh, hip what hop what hip what hop what hip what hop what hip what
Hop c'mon, c'mon, my soldiers, live soldiers, ready to ride

"It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

Pardon me love but you seem like my type
What you doin tonight? you should stop by the site
We could, roll some weed play some records and talk
I got a fly spot downtown Brooklyn, New York
Now I know you think I want to fuck, no doubt
but tonight we'll try a different route, how bout we start
With a salad, a fresh bed of lettuce with croutons
Later we can play a game of chess on the futon
See i ain't got to get in your blouse
It's your eye contact, that be getting me aroused
When you show me your mind, it make me want to show you mines
Reflecting my light, when it shines, just takin our time
Before the night's through, we could get physical too
I ain't tryin to say I don't want to fuck, cause I do
But for me boo, makin love is just as much mental
I like to know what I'm gettin into

We could have mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
Time for some mind sex...

Before we make love

Yeah, what you know about mind sex?

Before we make love

African princess, tell me yo' interests
Wait, let me guess boo, you probably like poetry
Here's a little something I jotted down in case I spotted you around
So let me take this opportunity
Would you share a moment with me, over herbal tea?
Take a walk verbally, make a bond certaintly
'cause in my hand I bet your hand fit perfectly
And it's like we floatin out in space when you flirtin wit me
c'mon, a little foreplay don't hurt (hmmm)
Imagine my chest under this shirt, your ass under your skirt
It's like walking the hot sands and finding an oasis
Opposites attract that's the basis
Our sex is the wind that separates the yin from the yang
The balance that means complete change, our aim
Is to touch you in a delicate spot
And once we get it started I ain't trying to stop

But first we have mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation

It's time for some mind sex, we ain't got to take our clothes off yet
We can burn the incense, and just chat
Relax, I got the good vibrations
Before we make love let's have a good conversation
Mind sex",7

We whole world operating off a (Cash money)
To all my niggas with a whole lotta (Cash money)
Watch yo' back money

You couldn't neva understand how my mind tick
I'm on some old school crime shit
When niggas sold two's to keep the dimes lit
Ain't no rules when these iron shots are stoned dun
This heat burn through your flesh, stright to the bones
I reach for the buddha cess and zone
I probably have a future of stress, stay depressed and be alone
But as far as the present time its on
I represent mine til I return to the S and said I'm dead and gone
Nobody want to be broke and you neither
Put me on the co'na, watch me catch a quick case of cream fever
If you be poppin shit my niggas won't believe ya
Probably punch you in the face and take ya wallet when we see ya
But son it gets deeper 
I'm runnin with a click that's bein' hunted by the grim reaper
To all my peoples in the man keeper 
Let'cha situation be a teacher
Ain't nothin like a education 
When I was locked down I learned about patience and dedication
And not to say shit, unless you need a motherfuckin face lift
And as a youth I was a outcast
Runnin around with ?pelagons? playin war but now it's all about cash

Chorus:

I'm caught up, caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't tryin to hear shit til my got cash to get
Blast you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind its all about cash in a fistfull
I'm caught up in a mix of shit
And I ain't tryin to hear shit til my got cash to get
Splash you with the pistol
If I have to, in my mind its all about cash in a fistfull

Up late night and upset, and fed up
Niggas comin up wet, I'm dead up
Fuck tryin to your head up
And when it go down, word bond we gotta get up
Too many locked down upstate, son its a set up
My life has sped up, many years I'm straight up
Plenty bears for who ain't here and those who ate up
Test and get sprayed up in the club
We couldn't run it so we take the blade up in the booth
Since we couldn't shoot
We heat it up, losin the shirt, showin the bare chest
I'm blessed, puffin the skunk make me care less
The best that you can do is duck my fuckin crew
If the slugs don't get'cha, lord J'll jig ya
Actin artificial you'll get burnt my the pistol
Before its done, even my guns'll turn to missles
Don't have to blow the whistle on you
'cause everybody knows you
Watch yourself around borderline pyschos
Who know my people gotta hold a mint
Or they ain't worth a cent
How can you represent, if you can't pay the rent
And leave a dent in my life time, I'm caught up in trife crime
In fights you neva know what you might find
We stand firm meanwhile 'cause niggas that seem wild
Be buckin blanks, if they were men they wouldn't fuck with pranks
I leave them niggas alone and stay home
Unitl it cool down as they remember how my tool sound

Forever keeping my shit cocked for drama
Stainless steal, shit is for real
The way these rats is known to squeal, makin' sour deals
Thugs up in to mix with these drugs, caught up in the humble
Bricks and paper by the bundle how the Bronx humble
??? devils get deaded, never regret it, only known to set it
Stealin existence obviuosly ya jetted
Speak the desest, I see the pyramid and eagle
Back of the dollar bill, ill decitful, we consider leathal
God fallin, niggas be ballin, guzzlin alcoholics
Two drinks, too many is like whitey infulltrating your fortress
This is on, we 'bout to form, best prepare for the storm
Ya'll funny niggas quick to ring the alarm
Bomb fell, now a nation is gel
We had to dwell for four hundred or more
The Lord had the right just livin poor
Resurrectin the true and livin back the power

"You have the emergence in human society 
Of this thing that's called the State
What is the State?  The State is this organized bureaucracy
It is the police department.  It is the Army, the Navy
It is the prison system, the courts, and what have you
This is the State it is a repressive organization
But the state and gee, well, you know, 
You've got to have the police, cause.. 
If there were no police, look at what you'd be doing to yourselves!
You'd be killing each other if there were no police!  
But the reality is
The police become necessary in human society 
Only at that junction in human society 
Where it is split between those who have and those who ain't got

I throw a Molotov cocktail at the precinct, you know how we think
Organize the hood under I Ching banners
Red, Black and Green instead of gang bandanas
F.B.I. spyin' on us through the radio antennas
And them hidden cameras in the streetlight watchin' society
With no respect for the people's right to privacy
I'll take a slug for the cause like Huey P.
While all you fake niggaz try to copy Master P
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street, where the people live
We sick of workin' for crumbs and fillin' up the prisons
Dyin' over money and relyin' on religion for help
We do for self like ants in a colony
Organize the wealth into a socialist economy
A way of life based off the common need
And all my comrades is ready, we just spreadin' the seed

[Chorus]
The average Black male
Live a third of his life in a jail cell
Cause the world is controlled by the white male
And the people don't never get justice
And the women don't never get respected
And the problems don't never get solved
And the jobs don't never pay enough
So the rent always be late; can you relate?
We livin in a police state

No more bondage, no more political monsters
No more secret space launchers
Government departments started it in the projects
Material objects, thousands up in the closets
Could've been invested in a future for my comrades
Battle contacts, primitive weapons out in combat
Many never come back
Pretty niggaz be runnin' with gats
Rather get shot in they back than fire back
We tired of that - corporations hirin' blacks
Denyin' the facts, exploitin' us all over the map
That's why I write the shit I write in my raps
It's documented, I meant it
Every day of the week, I live in it; breathin' it
It's more than just fuckin believin' it
I'm holdin' them ones, rollin' up my sleeves an' shit
It's cee-lo for push-ups now, many headed for one conclusion
Niggaz ain't ready for revolution

[Chorus]",5
"Intro: (news snippets)
""Let me now turn, to our program for the future...""
""The economy right now, is extremely supportive of the president and his 
policies""
""FBI scientists have found chemical traces, consistent with a bomb or a 
missile, on a piece of wreckage...""
""Police using clubs and tear gas against demonstrators...""
""They called me a mother -(bleeped out)-ing so-and-so...and a white 
facist...like they said, 'you're getting some of your own medicine'...""

Singing:
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our babies
Only truth, can take us...

Verse 1:
You can't fool all the people all of the time
But if you fool the right ones, then the rest will fall behind
Tell me who's got control of your mind? your world view?
Is it the news or the movie you're taking your girl to? (uh)
Know what i'm sayin cause Uncle Sam got a plan 
If you examine what they tellin us then you will understand
What they plantin in the seeds of the next generation
Feeding our children miseducation 
No one knows if there's UFO's or any life on mars
Or what they do when they up in the stars
Because i don't believe a word of what the president said
He filling our head with lies got us hypnotised
When he be speaking in cold words about crime and poverty
Drugs, welfare, prisons, guns and robbery
It really means us, there's no excuse for the slander
But what's good for the goose, is still good for the gander
See...

Chorus:
I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago i woulda been a panther
They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer
The views that you see in the news is propaganda

Singing:
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our children
Telling lies, to our babies
Only truth, can take us...
 
Verse 2:
I don't want no computer chip in my arm
I don't want to die by a nuclear bomb
I say we all rush the pentagon, pull out guns 
And grab the intercom, my first word's will be I believe
Man made God, outta ignorance and fear
If God made man, then why the hell would he put us here?
I thought he's supposed to be the all loving
The same God who let Hitler put the Jews in the oven
We don't fall for the regular shit, they try to feed us 
All this half-ass leadership, flippin position 
They turn politcian and shut the hell up and follow tradition
For your TV screen, is telling lies to your vision
Every channel got some brainwashed cop shit to watch
Running up in niggas cribs claiming that they heard shots
It's a plot, but busta can you tell me who's greedier?
Big corporations, the pigs or the media?
Sign of the times, terrorism on the rise
Commercial airplanes, falling out the sky like flies
Make me wonder what secrets went down with Bob Brown (?)
Who burnt churches to the ground with no evidence found?
It's not coincidence, it's been too many studied incidents
It coulda been the Klan who put that bomb at the Olympics
But it probably was the FBI, deep at the call
'cause if they make us all panic then they can start martial law

Chorus:
I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago i woulda been a panther
They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer
The views that you see in the news is propaganda

I don't believe Bob Marley died from cancer
31 years ago i woulda been a panther
They killed Huey cause they knew he had the answer
The views that you see in the news is muthafuckin propaganda

Singing:
Police is telling lies fooling millions
What are they teaching our kids in these school buildings?
Televised, enterprised in all the killing 
Controlling our lives, this ain't living 
No this ain't living

""uh, we view each other uh, with uh, a great love and a great understanding 
and that we

oppressed people all over the world, and, i think that uh, we differ from 
uhmm... uh, some other groups simply because we understand the system better 
than uh, most uh, groups understand the system, and uh, with this

"Intro:

""I was born, in a dump
My mama died and my father got drunk
They left me, to die or grow
In the middle of Tobacco Road
I grew up in a rusty shack
All i owned was hangin on my back
And Lord knows, how I learnt
This place called Tobacco Road
Tobacco Road, you're dirty and you're filthy
Tobacco Road, gonna get me some dynamite and a crane
I'm gonna blow it up, Lord knows gonna start all over again""

""My mind is the place where I make my plans
 The world is the place where I take my stand
 The beauty of life is mine today
 They cannot take my mind away""

[M1]
Fuck what you heard, I'm from Africa
This ain't no act it's mathematical
Past the black radical
I choose the M1, because it's practical
Nothin was changed, we ain't protected
No names, it's all factual
They push the wrong buttons, count down to detonate
Brooklyn blown away and the world will have to speculate
This is what we learn in the streets, fuck a degree
Believe in none of what you hear and half of what you see

[Stic]
It's like watching your own father smoke crack
I have nightmares on shit like that
No way in hell I'll ever get like that
I seen a lot of shit in twenty-two years
It's like a tour of duty
My life is booby-trapped, it's hard to see the beauty
When your heart is turning ice cold
Cold like your hands exposed to blistering winds
My mother keep her eyes closed, she say she prayin
I listen close to what she sayin 
When she speak of Jesus I ignore it
But when it's practical I'm all for it
You got to think like a soldier
I'm training myself to snatch pistols out of holsters
Discipline keep the mind focused
This whole world is a corn field son
Look out for flying locusts

Chorus (x2)

Don't let 'em get in your head, they try to probe you
Figure your thoughts so they can try and control you
And through you, control your whole crew
It's psychology boy, now what the fuck that make you want to do?

[M1]
You can't walk the streets with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
And if you know the time, give me a sign
Tell me where we draw the line
I got your back if you got mine
My enemy's enemy is my man
One dreadlock is stronger than one strand while the crackers got the upper hand
My comrades stand on lands stolen
Every tooth a golden opportunity
Who holdin my community hostage?
10% ransom, costing us time we lost and some
This is how the plan runs
Thinkin with a fugitive brain
What we do to live is insane
Holdin the weed, healing my membranes
Just like crack, you know it all boils down 
to the dollars-and-cents of it
Niggaz commence to get ? to sentenced to serve terms
Jumping the fence, the black germ is loose
When will they learn?
Psychology

[Stic]
We piss on walls and smoke reefa in the halls
No respect for their laws
I cut your face with a kitchen knife
In gladiator times, man against machinery
The tree bark fatigues help me blend in with the scenery boy
Life is a series of serious choices
Theories is formed from experience, never mysterious forces
Various courses of life can lead to failure
Too much of anything is a trap
My mind snap
Guerilla warfare for two grand
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man...
They say karate means 'empty hands'
So then it's perfect for the poor man

Chorus (x2)

Bridge

[M1]
When you think of us think of pyramids and pistols
And glimmering gold teeth that shine like crystals
The mind is like a jewel son
Only a fool wouldn't grasp it
Wisdom is a tool, you get blasted
When you think of us think of pyramids and pistols
And glimmering gold teeth that shine like crystals
The mind is like a jewel son
Only a fool wouldn't grasp it
Wisdom is a tool, you get blasted

""Free your mind, and the rest will follow
 Seize the time, no-one is promised tomorrow""

"I was born black, I live black, 
and I'ma die probably because I'm black
because some cracker that knows I'm black
better than you nigga, is probably gonna put 
a bullet in the back of my head!!

Yeah our lives fucked up, no doubt
All this shit we go through every day
Sometimes a nigga don't know what the fuck to do
But see I got my niggas
And we gon organize a people army
And we gon get control over our own lives
And I mean that shit right there from the bottom of my shit
I Ching

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah
Imagine havin no runnin water to drink
Chemicals contaminate the pipes leadin to your sink
Just think, if the grocery stores close they doors
And they saturate the streets with tanks and start martial law
Would you be ready for civil war
Could you take the life of somebody you know, 
or have feelings for if necessary?
I got cousins in the military
But far as I'm concerned they died, when they registered

[Verse 2]
Yo, this world is oh so cold, I think about my ancestors
Being sold, and it make me want to break the mold
Fuck the gold and the party, train yourself, clean your shottie
Tell me what you gon do to get free, we need more than MC's
We need Hueys, and revolutionaries
The niggas on the streets today, it's kinda scary
The smell around my way ain't roses or strawberries
In fact it's kinda poisonous, bringin out the boy in us
But I'ma stand up on my own, like a man do
Dominate the land and make wealth, like Fu-Manchu
Yes the peoples army stick togehther like glue
We represent the I-Ching, and to this we stand true
Military formation, anyone participation is welcome
Each one teach one, son help son
Just one gun is all it take to get it started
Livin in the wilderness of the west we cold hearted

HOOK 2X:
If you don't think it could happen think again my son
Be prepared for the worst that's yet to come
We want freedom, prophecies and ancient wisdom
Cataclsym, niggas be like fuck the system

I don't want to be no movie star
I don't want to drive no fancy car
I just want to be free, to live my life, to live my own life

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm for peace
But I'll kill ya if ya fuck with my moms or my niece
See we all want peace, but the problem is
Crackers want a bigger piece
Got it where the niggas can't get a piece
That's why police get stabbed and shot
'cause a nigga can't eat if the ave is hot
Locked up you get three hot meals and one cot
Then you sit and rot, never even got a fair shot
That's where a whole lotta niggas end up
My man moms even got sent up, tryin to keep the rent up
When I'm bent up I think a lot about the reason I'm here
I think about the things I fear in the comin years
Ahead of me, I'm ready for whatever they bring though
I'd go against a tank wit a shank for my dreams
And that's my fuckin word
One day the whole world will smoke herb
And niggas won't get took to jail for hangin on the curb

HOOK 2X

(next part of hook)

HOOK",5
"I'm not a hunter but I am told,
That, uh, in places like in the arctic,
Where indiginous people sometimes might, might, hunt a wolf,
They'll take a double edged blade,

And they'll put blood on the blade,
And they'll melt the ice and stick the handle in the ice,
So that only the blade is protruding,
And that a wolf will smell the blood and wants to eat,

And it will come and lick the blade trying to eat,
And what happens is when the wolf licks the blade,
Of course, he cuts his tongue, and he bleeds,
And he thinks he's really having a good thing,

And he drinks and he licks and he licks,
And of course he is drinking his own blood and he kills himself,
That's what the Imperialists did with us with crack cocaine,
You have these young brothers out there who think they are getting something

They gonna make a living with,
They is getting something they can buy a car,
Like the white people have cars, why can't I have a car?
They getting something they can get a piece of gold,

White people have gold, why can't I have gold?
They getting something to get a house,
White people have a house, why can't I have a house?
And they actually think that there's something that's bringing resources to them,

But they're killing themsleves just like the wolf was licking the blade,
And they're slowly dying without knowing it.
That's what's happening to the community, you with me on that?
That's exactly, precisely what happens to the community,

And instead of blaming the hunter who put the damn handle and blade in the ice
For the wolf,
That what happens is the wolf gets the blame, gets the blame for trying to live,
That's what happens in our community,

You don't blame the person, the victim,
You blame the oppressor, Imperialism, white power is the enemy,
Was the enemy when it first came to Africa,
And snatched up the first African brothers here against our will,

Isss the enemy today,
And that's the thing that we have to understand.",6
"Now there's two things that's the same
In every hood, in every ghetto across the world
And that's struggle, and that's dreams

In my hood, Southside Tallahassee, FL
I had both of those, still got both of those
I?ma let you in on somethin? real quick

Let's take it back to the early ?90s
Taleho, Florida is where you'll find me
'78 Omega automobile I'm driving
Bass bamblin? with the wind behind me

Hitch from the attic is the name of the crew
?Coz road shows and hoes that's all we do
And all three P's believe me, we got that hot shit
To the point that nigga 'bout to quit on college

Parents upset ?coz I shat on school

Went down, found out my girl was cheatin'
Heart broke, tired, started freakin'
Year later terminated for no reason

Got a new girl as the leaves turn brown
Seein' me stressed said she would hold me down
Had to move to the Bronx where the crooks be juxin?
Sold my first track, moved back to Brooklyn

Music 101, the whole game is dirty
Got me 25, feelin' all of 30
Went from a lover to straight up hustler
Stressed a lot, developed clusters

2 G, Y2K bug is gone
Put my gas mask back 'coz them lights is on
Dead Prez in the stores and the streets is groovin'
Hi, I'm still broke and my beats is movin'

Gotta grind harder 'coz my bills is major
Got a cell phone, had to dead the pager
Can't blame the game 'coz the game don't feed you
Can't blame the world 'coz the world don't need you

Seem like every excuse I use is see-through
Help myself first, then help my people
'Coz folks sells hope, runnin' scams to burn me
Wash me, comb me, relax and perm me

Gotta get control and stop this car from swerving
Now I'm kinda cold, only the doe concerns me
Try to spend less than the amount I'm earnin'
Lessons everyday I'm learnin'

Out in the world
(Where you tryin' to make it at)
Out in the world

"Holton Street
Dean Street, click clack
President, uh huh
Nostril out, DP's
Orange Al, RPG's
T-Town, who wanna ride?
Brooklyn, come on, come on

Sittin' in' the livin' room on the floor
All the pain got me on some migraine shit
But I'm gonna maintain
Nigga got 2 or 3 dollars to my name
And my homies in the same boat goin' through the same thing

Ready for a cake, better plot for the paper
We been livin' in' the dark since April
On the candle, gotta get a handle
My homie got a 25 automatic added to the caper

Nigga get the phonebook look up in the yellow page
Lemme tell you how we fin' to get paid
We gonna order take out and when we see the driver
We gonna stick the 25 up in his face

Let's ride, steppin' outside like warriors
Head to the notorious Southside
One weapon to the four of us
Hidin' in the corridor until we see the beam from car headlights

White boy in' the wrong place at the right time
Soon as the car door open up he mine
We roll up quick and put the pistol to his nose
By the look on his face he probably shitted in his clothes

You know what this is, it's a stick up
Gimme the do' from your pickups
You ran into the wrong niggaz
We runnin' down the block hot with these stacks of boxes
So we split up and met back at the apartment

Hell yeah, yo ain't you hungry my nigga?
Hell yeah, you wanna get paid my nigga?
Hell yeah, ain't you tired of starvin' my nigga?
Hell yeah, well let's ride then
Hell yeah, hell yeah

I know a way we can get paid you can get down
But you can't be afraid
Let's go to the DMV and get a ID
The name says you but the face is me

Now it's your turn take my paper work
Like 1, 2, 3 let's make it work
Then, fill out the credit card application
And it's gonna be 'bout 3 weeks a waitin'

For American Express, Discover Card
Platinum Visa, Master Card
'Cause when we was spooked as shit then we was targets
Now we just walk right up and say, ""Charge it!""

To the game we rockin' brand names
Well known at department store chains
Even got the boys in the crew a few things
Po po never know who to true blame

Sto' after sto' you know we kept rollin'
Wait two weeks, report the car stolen
Repeat the cycle like a like a laundry mat
Like a glitch in the system it's hard to catch

Comin' out the mall with the shoppin' bags
We can take it right back then get the cash
Yeah, get a friend and then do it again
Damn right, that's how we paid the rent

Hell yeah
Time to get this paper
I'm down for the caper
Please steady on

It's a deadly struggle
We all gotta hustle
This is the way we survive

Time to get this paper
I'm down for the caper
Please steady on

It's a deadly struggle
We all gotta hustle
This is the way we survive

I know a caper
We can get some government paper
You know food stamps, can we really do that?
Hell yeah, right there for the takin'
Fuck welfare, we say reparations

And, uh, you know the grind
Get up early get in the line and just wait
Everybody on break that's part of the game
And when they call your name
Ms. Case Worker let my state my claim

I'm homeless, jobless, times is hard, I'm 'bout hopeless
But I gotta eat regardless
No family to run to I'm 22
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

My sad story made her feel close to me
I made her feel like it was an emergency
When I came to the crib niggaz couldn't believe
I came back with a big bag of groceries, hell yeah

Every job I ever had I had to get on the first day
I find out how to pimp on the system
Two steps ahead of the manager
Gettin' over on the regular tax free money out of the register

And when I'm workin' late nights
Stockin' boxes I'm creepin' they merchandise
And don't put me on dishes I'm droppin' them bitches
And takin' all day long to mop the kitchen shit

We ain't gettin' paid commission, minimum wage
Modern day slave conditions
Got me flippin' burgers with no power
Can't even buy one off what I make in an hour

I'm not the one to kiss ass for the top position
I take mine off the top like a politician
Where I'm from doin' dirt is a part of living
I got mouths to feed, dawg, I gots to get it

Hell yeah, you down to roll my nigga?
Hell yeah, you ready to get your hands dirty my nigga?
Hell yeah, your woman need money and things my nigga?
Hell yeah, well let's ride then
Hell yeah

If you claimin' gangsta
Then bring on the system
And show that you ready to ride

'Til we get our freedom
We got to get over
Please steady on the grind

If you claimin' gangsta
Then bring on the system
And show that you ready to ride

'Til we get our freedom

Every hustlin nigga
Strugglin niggaz
Revolutionary niggaz
Gangbangin niggaz
Chain gangin niggaz

I refuse to be a stereotype in your box
Never want to try to be somethin I'm not
I'm just a nigga from the block, if you got it twist it
Stay blowin on green, if you got it twist it on up

RBG'd up in some gangsta chucks
Throw yo fist up homie if you know what's up
All my comrades puttin in soldier work
We rollin dirty wit it
Fully dedicated
So real that the radio will never play it
But that's cool, the enemies supposed to hate it
Freedom ain't gonna come till we regulate it
That's why I'm in the dojo, not just for the video
Really do, we really got beef with the popo
Never know when they gonna put you in a choke hold
This is for you new niggaz holdin for the radio

Chorus:
Turn off the radio
Turn off that bull shit

People's Radio
Yo hang up, that's police

What's on the radio? Propaganda, mind control
And turnin it on is like puttin on a blind fold
Cause when you bringin it real you don't get rotation
Unless you take over the station
And yeah I know it's part of they plans
To make us think it's all about party and dance
And yo it might sound good when yo spittin you rap
But in reality don't nobody live like that
You want to know what kinda nigga I am
let me tell you bit the nigga I'm not
I don't fuck with the cops
Platinum don't me that it gotta be hot
I ain't gotta love it even if they play it a lot
You can hear it when you walk the streets
How many people they reach
How they use music to teach
A radio program ain't a figure of speech
Don't sleep, cause you could be a radio freq

"[intro sample vocals from ""American Pimp""]
So much shit goes on it makes me doubt about a God -- you know, makes me ask
well if there is a God then why am I in the situation that I'm in?
Or why is my family going through certain situations
when I don't think that they deserve it nah mean?
Or why do good people suffer so much and bad people prosper so much?

[sample fades out as instrumental comes in]

[lighter sparking]

Yo
Goin out...we light this J up right here...for all the hard working folk
cross this country, cross the world
For everybody on the grind everyday 9 to 5, 8 to 12 -- you know how we do it
Hand to hand, whateva...
Yo, yo..

[Chorus - singing]
I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
I ain't tellin' you nothing you don't already know
I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
Like this world just don't want us to groooow

I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
I ain't tellin' you nothing you don't already know
I been working all my life but ain't got nothin' to show
want to run up in tha white house and kick in tha do' ohhhhh

[Verse 1]
What a nigga gonna eat when the refrigerator empty?
Work all week let the bossman pimp me?
Can't pay no rent till the 15th
Landlord call the police to evict me
Lookin for a job in the want ads
Have you ever been to jail? Know they gone ask
Ever took a piss test that you didn't pass?
In between jobs in the past? How you get cash?
I done worked over hot ass stoves
I done picked up trash off roads
Winter time in the streets and the cold
Many times had to sleep in my clothes on the flo'
What you know bout bein' po' seein' most of yo kinfolk be on dope?
Ain't nobody in the hood got no hope in this fucked up system and that's why we don't vote
Still payin niggaz 4.25 - How the fuck we supposed to survive?
I'm close to the edge, government takin most of my bread
in taxes might as well have this close to my head
Make a nigga want to wild out
runup in the white house with the gauge out, CLICK CLACK!
GIMME MY SHIT BACK BEEYOTCH!

[Chorus]

Puttin' on my uniform, just a number on a W-4 form..

[Verse 2]
See where I'm from it's a few ways out
either rappin or sports either dope or the casket
You can work to the bone but don't put all yo eggs in one basket
We don't never get a piece of the pie
Work 50 years, retire then die
Stay po', rich folks is the criminal
but you don't want to hear me tho' so
thank God it's friday, ain't it what we live fo'?
Nigga gotta get up out the plantation
Same job that my pop had before me
Imma pass it down to my seed fucked up situation
Make a nigga want to wild out
runup in the white house with the gauge out, CLICK CLACK!
GIMME MY SHIT BACK BEEYOTCH!

[Chorus]

My J-O-Beeee

My J-O-Beeee

"*guitar plays and birds in the background*

(Verse 1)
What you know about the running, the stretching
The cars, the weapons
The path, the journey
The jewels, the learning
The fear, the focus
The aches, the pains
The contact sparrin', the breaks, the sprains
The trial and error, the ranks, and belts
The spiritual growth, the science of breath
The tests, the techniques
The forms, the stances
The flow, the rhythm, the internal answers
The herbs, the healing, the quiet meditation
The truths reveal through daily dedication
The love for the art, the sweat on your shirt
The mind, the body, and the spirit that work
The feelings of failure, the hope to succeed
The battles of questions like ""Should I smoke weed?""

(Verse 2)
The water, the thirst
The cleansing, the blessings
The flash of insights, the teachings, the lessons
The grappling and locking, trapping and boxing
The training and slacking
The starting and stopping
And stayin' committed, when your homies ain't with it
The hours or practice after the class is finished
The cause of your ignorance, flaws in your discipline
Broken laws of nutrition, and pork and dishin'
The vitamins and supplements
Salads and ointments

The kingships, pull joints in doctor appointments
The dues, the pads, the wraps, the gloves
The mouthpiece you left home, the taste of your own blood
The hunger, the blocks
The punches, the squats
The crunches, the example you set for the youngsters
The will, the skills, the kill or the hill
The separation between what's fake and what's real
The laws of physics, The class ""comradery""
The vows of humility, the bow, the courtesy.

Self defense doesn't mean you run and attack someone
But you do have the right to defend yourself by any means necessary

You already know what time it is
Dead... prez... dot... com
Information news

Everywhere we go
Every day on TV
They be talking about
Who you gonna vote for
You got a black man running
But I wonder if he get in
Who he gonna open up the door for?
I don't wanna to discourage my folk
I believe in hope
I just want us to want more
Politics is a game
How they keep us contained
There gotta be more that we could hope for
Democrats and Republicans
Just 2 sides of the same coin
Either way, it's still white power
It's the same system
Just changed form
You wanna vote? please do!
Cast your ballot, let your voice be heard
But what I do want to say is
After the election
You'll see
Mark my words

[Chorus]
It's politic time again
It's politrick time again
It's politic time again
It's politrick time again

Shoot the messenger!

This is the most important election of all time
The government's committing the biggest of all crimes
These bullshit politicians say they speaking for the people
Before they ran for office, they were shitting on the people
Billion dollar campaigns
Trillion dollar bailout
Anybody know the definition of a sell-out? huh?
And if Obama win, he wouldn't be the first black
Take your 2 dollar bill and turn it over to the back (you see? right there)
But with the TV on, you only hearing they voice
The system is broken, they trying to beat a dead horse
Go ahead and vote for the lesser of two evils
I plot, plan, and strategize with the poor people
The middle class will say this opinion is irresponsible
But if you ain't got no healthcare, they kickin' you out the hospital
McKinney, Clemente, off in the Green Party
No disrespect, we need a Red, Black, and Green Party
Like Marcus Garvey's

[Chorus]

Even if Obama wins
Uncle Sam ain't my friend

It's politrikkks time again
It's bullshit time again

The time is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor
And truth is on the side of the oppressed today; it's against the oppressor
You'll see it. You'll see terrorism",5

On the road with my bad friends. 
Stop to look at the tragedy. 
On the road. 
The road to nowhere. 
I'm missing all these things. 
That I left on the side of the road. 
I didn't lose but misplaced my mind. 
And I gave a sentimental sacrifice. 
And all the things that you do. 
Confuse you. you're my charity. 
I hope you see. 
And on the drive home. 
The light put the innocent on your face. 
And I'm stuck with my bad things. 
Am I going straight to hell. 
And all the things that you say. 
Get in the way. 
You're my charity. 
I hope you see. 
And all the things that you do. 
Destroy you. 
You die for the truth that you lose. 
Stop driving me on the road. 
The road to nowhere",4

Nothing is my fault

As I say nothing to you

Of all the things my love, won't you listen to me.
When I say
It takes one more chance to survive.
And to say that'd be easy, that's a lie.

When you are sorry for it all.
And I care.
Nothing is my fault.
You're leaving as I say nothing to you.
As I say nothing to you.

They've told me never let go who I am.
I am.
So hold me and promise that I can't.
So hold me forever never change.
Never change.
So hold me never.

It takes one more chance to survive.
Now to say that that'd be easy, that's fine.

When you are sorry for it all.

I'd be lying to you

Could never mean more than its sacrifice

Why we have come from so far away
Only to bring you something
Something already inside of you

The mind is the cage of the soul
The people are blind

Leading you over the edge 
And into the hole

Soon passing by

They'll fly us to the Sun

Of what I have done to myself
This is the end of life as we know it
Following the path chosen by our guide
A giant of a man, living two different lives
Not a moment's grace, this is where we draw the line
Face our fears or face the facts, this is where we die
We're on our own
But in this togeather
This is the end, prepare to die",6

"Cursed by everyone I have known
Lost control, now I'm alone
I hate this about myself
That you asked forgiveness
And I watched you burn
When every one of your promises falters and fails
As I know they would
I turn my back and go it alone, alone
When it seems it can't get worse
Burn it down, build it back
I will never see things the way you do
I cannot entertain the possibility of forgiveness
There is no way I can just forgive and forget
And for that I will be condemned and",3
"I know I'll never be good enough
And I don't care 'cause I'm never giving up
How does it feel when you can't hold your own?
How does it feel when desperation has left you alone?
It feels as if this burden is all I've ever known
And the weight pushing down on me continues to grow
I've live my life on my own terms
Gaining ground from everything I've learned
This is where we bury all that drags us down
This is where we break free to stand on our own ground",6
"Every one of us is lost against ourselves,
And pushing through the constant struggle of forward thought
This thing we call humanity
Has brought us down, and has us caught
Is this what I've become? A callous, uncaring soul
That allows the will of flesh to dominate and control
This is my counter attack
Starve the self, and empower the soul
This path I chose, once again made whole
Torn between self and soul
With first step forward
I've become a new creation
Free from self and thinking clearly
My soul chokes the last impurities from my flesh
And I'm given a second chance... but this time
I let myself die",6
"Up and out, I never regretted a thing
Take a glance from the inside, it isn't what you think
This is it, this is everything I have
So between you and me, give up all fucking hope

I've got the answer, so save your fucking explanation
This is the last time I'll suffer through your exploitation
Harvest truth and save it for your revelation
I've lost all trust and I've finally had the realization

All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fail you

Give up hope, give up all fucking hope
Give up hope, give up all fucking hope

I don't care and I'm through hearing you justify
You've given up and I know you've fucking died inside
We've burned it all and everything it signifies
I've reached my breaking point and I finally realize

All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fail you
All my heroes have failed me
And all your heroes will fucking fail you, fail me, fail you

Give up hope, give up hope
Give up hope, give up all fucking hope

I'm sick of trying and I'll never put my trust in you
No more heroes, no promise of something new
It's over now, there's no more damage that you can do
You're dead to me because me and you are finally through

All my heroes have failed me
And I have given up hope
This is the last time
I ever place my trust in someone else
And I have given up all fucking hope

Right from the start
Gnashing, ripping, bleeding
Quickly tears my flesh apart
Through my cloudy vision

Billows of crimson, signal the feast
One last bite, coming from all sides
Confusion, pain, mortality
Reminds that I cannot live
My last hope believe they let me go

Now which way is home?
Now which way is home?

"In our most painful moments
Lost in the cloak of night
Burned, broken, tired, hopeless
No future is in sight
Where are we even going and who among you cares?
With no real purpose showing
A cycle of despair
A never ending threat
A constant pushing force
My match is finally met
Let this thing take its course
New blood flows in our veins
Power moves quickly now
None of us will be the same
Giving up we won't allow
Our last sun has set
As we approach our fate
With one last option left
To destroy and recreate
We are the new generation
With purpose, conviction, and dedication
We are the new generation
With purpose, conviction, and dedication
Counting past the final hour
In Flame we've been reborn
A pure stronger power
A new oath we have sworn
These nights mean too much to just let them go
Putting on the final touch
Our true colors show
We are the new generation
With Purpose, conviction, and dedication
We are the new generation
With Purpose, conviction, and dedication
On the Phoenix Throne
Death and rebirth
On the Phoenix Throne
Death and rebirth
Nothing as far as the eye can see
A straight, clear path moving
Towards our destiny
And now we rise
We rise on the wings of flame
And now we rise
We rise on the wings of flame
Nothing holding us back
As we rise on wings of flame
Momentum pushing forward
As we rise on wings of flame
We are fireborn
As we rise on wings of flame
We are the Phoenix
As we rise on wings of flame

"They met in the dark of the night
For a final time, for the great showdown
Two dreamers deciding which path to take
One for their future, one for the present

I was standing strong until you showed your face
To ruin and ravage everything we've planned
Your dream is empty with its promise, your self fulfillment
The future holds so much more for us

One of us will die before this is over
One of us will die before this is over

The sword of vengeance glistens in the moonlight
Her words fall silent as he makes his attack
Now we will find out who truly holds the power
I'm waiting for you to relinquish your hold
There is no room for us so you must be destroyed
Then I'm afraid this is unavoidable

His blade plunges deep cutting down to the core
And with her last gasp for breath
All her dreams and aspirations fade
She pleads for him to see, to see, for him to see the truth

And with one final slice she's gone forever
No more dreams, no more tears, she's gone
And with one final slice she's gone forever
No more dreams, no more tears, she's gone

Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries
Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries
Bleed for nothing now, for no one hears your cries

He stands there victorious and alone
Suffering through what he himself has made
Without her, there is no point to my fight
He sees it all as it slowly begins to fade

One of us will die before this is over
One of us will die before this is over

He realizes now without her
Life loses point
Without the battle, without their struggle
Life loses point

He has no purpose now
Life loses point
As everything fades, everything fades
Life loses point

The struggle was keeping us both alive
The struggle was keeping us both alive
The struggle was keeping us both alive
The struggle was keeping us both alive

I, betrayer of hearts, I, servant of sorrow

Hear I am, the worthless king
Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless king
Join my legions of heartless
Here I am the worthless king
Join my legions of useless

Wandering the great depths
Searching the canyons for truth
Discovering every darkness
Bringing its ugliness into new light

Here's your next catchy melody

So, say what you will
And do what you feel you must
Your words just fuel my rage
And fill my heart with disgust

I know what really matters
And I know who will be there
The rest of you could wither away
And not a piece of me would care

Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing
Tomorrow, none of you will mean a goddamn thing

Reborn into this fleshen form
Forced through the portal of the womb

"A weary man with haunted eyes,
showed up at my door last night
He said he was a friend of mine,
his face had changed since he'd done his time.
I let him in for a little while,
After a drink he began to smile,
and laughed and said 'The world's his prison cell
Somewhere between Heaven and Hell
Somewhere between Heaven and Hell.

Waiting for the day to come

The wind howled and began to moan,
the lamp flickered and the house groaned.
The pressure changed, my hands grew cold
as I remembered the story the locals told
About a man who will visit you,
with haunted eyes to collect his due
He was a tax-collector like Matthew,
and if he comes he comes for you.
And if he comes he comes for you.

This is a holy place

went for the keys on the back bookshelf
And when I went to turn around,
he was standing there holding my keys in his hand.
He said ""You think you can get away? 
Don't you know this is judgement day?""
And I said ""I won't except that fate"" and I had no time to hesitate
I had no time to hesitate

This is a holy place

And if he comes, he comes for you,
And if he comes, he comes for you
And if he comes, he comes for you

"Lonely times, are haunting me
Just like a ghost in my house
You wait for dawn, like an angel to come
And pull you out of this place

Lonely people feeling blue
Lonely people just like you

There are times, to say
""We have grace - and so much to give.""
And we say prayers to Jesus
Because Jesus has felt our pain

Lonely people just like Him
When will they ever fit in?
I can't hear for the traffic noise
the lonely people playing with their toys

Lonely people feeling blue
Lonely people just like you.

"William was a gun-fighter he was looking for his chance
Waiting for his time to come when he could make his name
Riding into town with a look upon his brow like he's gonna take from you
Or gonna take you out.

Phoenix was an Indian who had a knack for robbing banks
In the mesas of New Mexico is where they made their plans
To rob the Denver bank and to leave no one alive
And with their plans they rode northeast, their fingers on their guns
Looking for an angel or the pale rider to come
Looking for an angel or the pale rider to come

There back in Santa Fe, where you will find my love
A Spanish maid named Isabelle, with skin like holy dove
And if this plan goes bad, and I should meet my end
You send her Texas and make sure to treat her well

Connor was a law man - he protected the Denver Bank
He vowed to catch the riders, he vowed to see them hanged.
He told his men ""Be ready and when you see the rider's come,
Put a bullet between their eyes"" and the pale rider he comes
A bullet between the eyes and the pale rider he comes.

On the Denver horizon, that's where it all went down
Getting into to focus as the riders dust settled down
Connor had the street staked out and ready for the draw
And the tension mounted in the heat of it all
Connor said ""Don't worry, I'm scared to death myself
When I look into his eyes I see a demon straight from hell!
Coming straight for me - coming for the kill""
That's when the shots were fired
BANG
And it was done

All were looking for an angel when the pale rider, he comes
Looking for an angel an the pale rider he comes . . .

"Oh, holy night
Oh holy, holy day
Oh carry me, carry me away
When we first went down
Juarez was a different town
""Gracias"" was all I could say.

Rosa Marie tonight
Blessed Marie tonight

You're not looking for love,
Just an escape she said
But the boot is on the other foot this time
And we, we can be friends
We can make amends
If your prayers to Mary are heard

Rosa Marie, tonight
Blessed Marie, tonight

I'm not looking for an escape or a holy grail
I'm not looking for an easy way out
I'm just looking for the ""Cross of Santa Fe""

Rosa Marie, tonight
Blessed Marie, tonight

"We take no prisoners, when it rains it pours
Give me time, give me sweet by and by
And I know we can make it through it.
When they say that it's not true when I say that I love you,
It's alright - I'll be standing by your side
When they say that it's not so, he won't be with you when
You grow old, it's alright - I'm hear to prove 'em wrong.

Chorus
So give 'em time and they'll come around
You gotta stay alive when the sun goes down
To see the glory of a city open wide
Cause tonight darling, you will be my bride.

Well the people up in Detroit - they get their soul from Marvin Gaye
And the people down in California, get their sunshine in L.A.
From the bluegrass to the blues, Elvis Presley's ""Blue Suede Shows""
Singing sweet Mississippi ghost crooning slide guitar
Down in Texas, it's alright with it's hot tequila nights
Selling romance of riding into Mexico.

Chorus

Well the preachers down in Greenwood, they stomp the Gospel out on hardwood floors
And the gamblers lost in Vegas, don't believe it anymore
Well they're trying just to behave hearing Robert Johnson from the grave
Running scared with the hell-hounds still on his trail
And Jacob in the field - to the angel's strength he yields
You feel the spirit moving and its hard to fail.

Three murders . . .
Three murders' what the headlines say
They contradict the blackened day
And there's nothing that can stop it they say.
Three victims
Three victims laid to rest
The cops all protest, the claim to have done their best

That there's nothing more they can do, nothing more they can do

Juarez,
Juarez is a haunted place
The ambulances try and race
To beat the other's to the place where
Three women
all working for the mighty peso, can't seem to let it go
and the numbers still climb and grow

And there's nothing more they can do, nothing more they can do

How long is to long and you've had enough?
How little is too late to stop it and the hate goes on and on.

And I hope you see the light of day
I hope you see the light of day. . .

"I see violence coming around the bend
Violence is coming around the bend
I see violence burning bright - cuts through the murky night
And the water is washing over me

I walk through the shadow of death
I walk through the shadow of death
When a burning light cut's through the dreary night
And the water is washing over me

The soldier pierced Jesus in his side
The soldier pierced Jesus in his side
pierced Him with his sword - out holy water poured
And the water is washing over me.

"They used to tell me I was building a dream
And so I followed the mob
When their was earth to plow or guns to bear
I was always their right on the job

They used to tell me I was building a dream
With peace and glory ahead
Why should I be standing in line
Just waiting for bread?

Once I built a railroad, I made it run
Made it race against time
Once I built a railroad, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?

Once I built a tower up to the sun
Brick and rivet and lime
Once I built a tower, now it's done
Brother, can you spare a dime?

Once in khaki suits, gee we looked swell
Full of that Yankee-Doodly-dum
Half a million boots went sloggin' through Hell
And I was the kid with the drum

Say, don't you remember, they called me ""Al""
It was ""Al"" all the time
Why don't you remember, I'm your pal
Say buddy, can you spare a dime?

And I can't face the day
You keep me bound
And can't escape the fray

I'm much more than this 
But I don't mean much
I don't matter to you
'Cause I'm just a fuck

I should've never believed those things you said
Everything I felt inside is dead
I thought I meant something
I guess not I'm a precious nothing to you

I keep on losing face 
Until I'm erased
Welcome to the trends 
And spread the pop disease

You can't lose the friends 
That spread their legs to please you
I should've never believed 
The things you said

Everything I feel inside is dead
Wear The Mask!",5

Do you believe in heaven in above
Do you believe in love
Don't tell a lie
Don't be false or untrue

Open fire on my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defences are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own
If a girl walks in 
And carves her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Everyday we've all been lead astray
It's hard to be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Looking for love
Calling heaven above
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
But don't give up
Don't give up
You can be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Looking for love
Calling heaven above
Send me an angel
Send me an angel

Send me an angel
Send me an angel

Just seems to vanish in the end
It always dies before it begins to bloom

Glowing blue eyes upon me 
Waste us
Or make us slaves till death like upon me
Or turn around and fake they're proud
I've found my true calling 

Well beyond the mortal plane
Lies the place where one's life can be exchanged
No more conscience, no more pain
The now, the past, the future stay the same

"A morbid beauty
Glows in resonation 
Mercurial signs they read 
Make real our minds True fascinations 
For now we're rolling
And kinda golden 
As time keeps folding We're old when our poor souls depart 
Whereas cold cruel jokes now make you cry One day you'll take them in your stride
All of the time we've resided here 
You'll see our chalices rise With ever endless tears
And illusions they fly But someday soon will clear 
Just sit back and recline I'll guide you through the years 
Through the future years 
As they'll soon appear 
Someday all too near 
Now the distance clears 
Bad ways which rule all the ways we go 
Through black and the gloom 
Consecutive days and plain afternoons 
The things in life They pass the time While those all around are bored 
Though we come down in real demise
Trek through all of the feelings with no tears in eyes 
Kept fear veiled so it hides 
Life's never forced or dry 
So there's nothing inside me I just seem alive 
To the future years 
As they'll soon appear 
Dressed in slacks as we will 
So its stars they steer 
Just tie a silk sheet round your neck 
And twist it till your face turns cherry red 
All of the time we've resided here 
You'll see our chalices rise 
With ever endless tears 
And illusions they fly
But someday soon will clear 
Just sit back and recline I'll guide you through the years

"Laid awake throughout the night
Today the school's so loud
And now it's all so quiet
I plan to pack light
'Cause tomorrow we'll fly
Taking off to a place
A land that's not so far away 

The boat above our heads for the walk to the shore
As feelings of dread soak the length of the oar
Connecticut hillsides surround the clouds soar
Dazed to the signs
I think back to times when gender crossed me 

Miss all those Christmases
And the once careless Autumns 

Though there's space betwixt us which
Dissolves here round when the fog clears 

As we crept through the race
Old friends would line the banks
Cheering on as they played
Screaming all the lovely names
Then they'd start to file away
Come dust the time to rage 

The boat above our heads for the walk to the van
As luncheon awaits us while all the girls tan
And social engagements commence by the sand
Now our day is complete
We faced defeat, but felt the cool breeze 

Follow our dreams
And hold the lake in such dear regards
Against the best we thrusted
But the justice came when the bow touched",6
"The desperate eyes are closed maybe it goes away
Please rest tomorrow and bring a satisfied day
The restless urge of love that's worth the burning for
Surely it's that one comforting love to give you more
And that thought can be that begins the brand new tangled web your spinning
Anyone can be a brand new love
Any time the force can be broken to tear you bitter world to be open 
Anyone can be a brand new love

You won't be the first
Your twisted change is normal, gossip dirt
Whisper to the nodding head, thrilled you fell apart instead of them, but they will
'Cause any hope for love an be killed
If you need a different face, it's definite time to destroy this place

Follow what you feel you alone will decide what's real
Anyone can be a brand new love",6
"We gather today, with ill invitaion.
To commence here under the sun, a black congregation.
Some know me the hellion, the stranger among us.
Some know me the maggid, in moments the malign Alumnus.
Throughout my tenure, my time in the mansion, a coven arose,
Descendants truly Urantian.
Now please listen close, divide your attention.
An honor presides the
Negus has yet failed to mention.
We've altered the premise and renounced the maxims.
Low and behold the first row tears the Gog,
Alas the sky falls, rain the angels.

"How the story rolls
Magic's taught and history's told
A glory hole
Which through gazed her eyes of gold
Those veins run cold
Mystery's wife evades her soul
Scaring to and fro 

Tearing through the snow
As she makes her darling coat
Hoarding all the shawls
Now her evil highness rose 

Kind of like Shakespearean prose
Without the rose
Avid as she sows
Cruella grows
Horace and Jasper stole
So let the horror flow 

Black and white in hair
Elegantly gaunt in frame
A boney flare
Which christened Cruel with creepy grace
Always smokey air
Circling one lurch, Hepburn face
In her head which filled the space
Was the one hellacious taste
As she aims her fate
Nothing flees her sore embrace 

As the biggest mistake that Cruel ever made
Was when she left her cave and started to reign
As the love for her fades
Our feelings won't change
So my darling Cruella
We see through the grey 

In her cold glare
Loveliest and rare
Frightened you'll soon wear
And this elegantly haunting is so fair
There's no reason to part from her cold lair
She has all of the loveliest and rare 
Things which frighten at first
But she'll soon wear 

She's a regional spark from this nowhere
And this elegant loveliness so fair
Taking strolls through the dark by the moon's glare
As she listens for barks in the night air
Always searching for marks on the white hair 

Cruel, you're so fair

"I got the key, key to Gramercy Park

Every night
Looking for the fight
Thoughts on the left
The action's on the right
As you know, the id wasn't meant to be starved

Face white
Revenge of the Hittites
When you're inside
And you thought to take a walk in the park
Think someone is about to be carved

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find the key to Gramercy Park

I got the key, key to Gramercy Park
Where it's safe to be afraid of the dark
Maybe there we'll fuck by the heavenly stars
But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars

From the other side of the Underscene
To the boulevard of broken dreams
To find the key to Gramercy Park
In the other time of mother speed
Through evil eyes and make believe
To where we bare the supremacy mark

And never look at the other place
Stay with what's pristine that touches you
Where the peril accentuates
Something that could mean so much to you
Try save a seat in the golden cage
The media mass has still yet to say
To simply pass or rise from the grave

Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park
Out of my way and I'm safe, not afraid of the dark
Now I've got the key to Gramercy Park
But I might, might miss breaking in through the bars

"It was November, and I was a mess
And I was thinking of leaving her back then
As if by magic, you and I met
And it brought me back to life again

You've got a certain something about you
And I've got a past I want to leave behind
It's been a long, long time since I met someone
Who made me happy to be alive

Now the bell's of St. Paul's ring out in my head
Like the last few words she said

I can't go back to living in silence
No, I can't go back to sleeping alone
All the years she made me live as a liar
Ended up becoming all that I know

And I know you can't stand winters here
You said you never felt that kind of cold
I guess when you're from another hemisphere
It can sometimes feel like another world

You've got a way of making me hang on
To every single word you say
We stay up all night talking shit about
How I needed to get away

Now the bell's of St. Paul's ring out in my head
Like the last few words she said

I can't go back to living in silence

"Scrawled into the pavement, again and again. Written on the red stalls in smokey tin.
On the smokey tin, it melts again and again.
On the booths of the round table, again and again.
Drug onto the street and onto the soaking steps, again and again.
Endless debris sifting through static lungs, lingering into every pore
Laced with a bitter face near the dawning of the high and madness of the undertow
We audience who saved our roses. We audience who scoffed at the tears. 
Ugliness stretching toward the chandelier. Pale with pain
I imagined the overcome and fell to my knees before the endless 
Truth of instability and futility.
Now I know",5
"Imagine the gracious
Benevolent ritual of Death
Grave and porcelain
With baby blue lips and pale pink eyes
Descending toward me
Her glowing hands cradled at my head
And knees submerging me into waves of icy seas

I imagine the end

Then further downward so that I can rest
Cocooned by the heat of the ocean floor
In the dark, my flesh to disintegrate into consumption for the earth",5
"I woke in a sweat from a desirous fever in the pocket of yesteryear 
Where faults have fallen to some. 
I begged not to carry the corpse. 
To not be a queer fish in unforgiving hearts.
To not be buried in native clay and preserved for cynicism.
I wish to be a pauper in kind eyes. To feel the gravel beneath my knees. 
To wake in a home.
God had sent my calamity into a deep space from which not even in dreams, 
Could I ever imagine my escape",7

You got to not talk dirty, baby
If you want to impress me
You can't be to flirty, mama
I know how to undress me, yeah
I want to be your fantasy

I think I want to dance, uhh, ooohh
Gotta, gotta, oh

Gotta, gotta, gotta

Women not girls rule my world
I said they rule my world
Act your age, mama (not your shoe size) 
Not your shoe size
Maybe we could do the twirl
You don't have to watch Dynasty 
To have an attitude
You just leave it all up to me
My love will be your food

"Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue

Oh I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wond'ring no mis'ry can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell

Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flower",6
"The house was like a tomb.
I was hiding in my room.
As my brother made his way on down the hall.

I didn't want to say goodbye.
And I was trying to deny there was a war,
And that he got the call.

I watched him from my window
Walking down the drive.
Then I ran down the stairway
Through the front door and I cried

You come back you hear?
And I let him see my tears
I said I'll give you my rookie of DiMaggio.
I'll do anything you want,
Clean your room, or wash your car.
I'll do anything so long as you don't go.
But he said, this is what brothers are for.

Well I have my heroes,
But the one I love the most
Taught me how to hunt and swing a bat.
And I wrote him every night,
I said I miss our pillow fights,
But lately I just wonder where you're at.

Sometimes freedom makes it hard to live.
When it takes things from you that you don't want to give.

I said you come back you hear?
I miss you being near.
Laugh and fish down in the maple grove

I'll do anything you want.
There must be someone I can call,
And just maybe they would let you come back home.
But he wrote, this is what brothers are for.

I may never have to face the anger of those guns,
Or lie cold and wounded in my blood,
Or know the sacrifice and what it must of cost
For him to love me that much.

Well, it had been two years,
And I held back my tears
When I saw him in that wheel chair on the shore.

And as I ran and held him tight,
That's when he looked me in the eye
And said I'm sorry that you have to push me home.
And I said hey, this is what brothers are for.",5
"My Buddy Jake said hey its spring break so I picked him up in my truck

Get confused when you ask them to define it,
Cause its a miracle, 
It keeps the universe we see from ever dying,
And the stars from falling,
Though we can't see it
It must true 
And its the only thing I've found, to compare our love to

its invisible
You can't touch it
No matter where you go on earth you can't outrun it
It only exists to pull you in
Till your where your meant to be
Girl our love is a lot like gravity


Its a phenominal
How I can hunger for you're touch and need you're company
And its just beautiful,
How from across a crowded a room you're eyes will folow me till our bodies meet
And when I'm not with you I feel a tug inside my heart

"I love the way you twirl your hair
Those overalls and flip flops you wear
The way you'd smile waiting in your drive
Hot Sunday afternoons

You didn't mind my rusty truck
Swinging by to pick you up
I missed your sweet face, it was six long days
Since I'd got to hang with you

And we'd throw two fly rods in the gun rack
Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
Sing to brown eyed girl
My guitar in the barn bridge shade

I'd number your freckles
And the times your fishing line tangled
And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
No, it ain't hard to remember those good ol' lazy days

And we'd stop by Ernie's General store
Got two maple walnut ice cream cones
Funny how they always seem to get on your nose
Yeah, when you'd ride with me

I'd cuss the moon tryin' to get you back
Ground all the gears while you just laughed
'Cause it was twelve o'clock, porch lights turned off
Yeah, and I was up the creek

And we'd throw two fly rods in the gun rack
Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
Sing to brown eyed girl
My guitar in the barn bridge shade, yeah

I'd number your freckles
And the times your fishing line tangled
And love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
No, it ain't hard to remember those good ol' lazy days

Ain't it funny how we never could sell that old pick up of mine
Baby grab the keys, I'll get the jumper cables 'cause it's about time

And we threw two fly rods in the gun rack
Sweet tea and biscuits on your lap
Sang to brown eyed girl
My guitar in the barn bridge shade, hey, yeah

I'd number your freckles
And the times your fishing line gets tangled
Love on you in the meadow by round bales of hay
No, it ain't hard to remember, baby do you remember?
I think it's time we remembered those good ol' lazy days

"I'd say, I'm a lover, not a fighter
I never stare nobody down
'Til one night my girl
I could not find her
She never made it back from town

I found my Shannon crying in the woods
A wicked man held her down
So I stuck him deep and I buried him good
Not deep enough to fool the hounds

We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home

That train stopped in Tijuana
We built a shack beneath the sun
I make my Shannon margaritas
We watch our children laugh and run, run, run

Sometimes I miss my daddy
Sometimes I miss my mom
But I think they'd be real proud of me
To know the man that I've become

We took shelter in a chapel
'Neath the blood moon sky
I bought a gun and made Shannon my wife
We jumped in a box-car to old Mexico
Where I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home
No I ain't worth a penny of my bounty back home

Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on
Train, train roll on, roll on

Shannon, why'd you run with me?
She said,
What was I supposed to do boy?
Just watch you leave?
You'd have broken my heart
You'd have haunted my dreams
Your love, boy, is all I need
Your love, boy, is all I'll ever need

We took shelter in a chapel

"It was a beautiful sunny morning, so we went for a drive,
Hiked up in the mountains, and we lost track of time.
A kissin' and a huggin', never saw the sun go down,
I said ""Baby we're lost"", and she proceeded to freak out,
So I said,

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
And that coyote howls, and the grizzly bear he growls.
I can get you through the night, oh yes I can,
I'm a mountain man.

I gave her a little hug, I said ""There's no need to cry"",
I used to be a beaver scout all I need is this Buck knife.
I can carve a hook, pull fish from a brook and I bang on with a gun,
Except tonight I don't really have one, and well, that's half the fun.
Awe you know I'm only kiddin' hun.

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
I know you're a city girl, but if you had to you could eat a squirrel.
Yeah I'd cook him up just right, you know I can.
I'm a mountain man.

We could pick berries in the moonlight,
'Cause I know which ones to eat.
How to recognize poison ivy,
Should you go lookin' for leaves.

Baby baby don't panic, I know how to cook bannock.
I can build you a fire, I know you're tired, ain't this romantic?
I can bugle an elk, I can rattle a deer, I can grow you a big ol' bushy beard,
And live up here all year and never go back.
Yeah I'm a mountain man.
A man with a plan.
You're in good hands.
Yeah, I'm your mountain man.

The moments move the last seconds left of us.
The wheels will ride and tear their way between.
A tear will slide.

And 6 long months will separate 
Until I don't love you anymore.",6

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there 
She would merengue and do the cha-cha 
And while she tried to be a star 
Tony always tended bar 
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 til 4 
They were young and they had each other 
Who could ask for more? 

At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana) 
The hottest spot north of Havana (here) 
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana 
Music and passion were always in fashion 
At the copa they fell in love 

His name was Rico 
He wore a diamond 
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there 
And when she finished,he called her over 
But Rico went a bit to far 
Tony sailed across the bar 
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two 
There was blood and a single gun shot 
But just who shot who? 

At the copa she lost her love 

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl, 
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show 
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola, 
Still in dress she used to wear, 
Faded feathers in her hair 
She sits there so refined,and drinks herself half-blind 
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony 
Now she's lost her mind

"Autumn seems awful lonely here whenever we think of you
Last night the sky was purple and we wanted to share the view
The leaves on the trees are turning and the woods are all ablaze
The smell of the timber burning in the fireplace

Sunday we woke up early and we drove out to Tyson's farms
Gorging ourselves on all the cider and donuts we could fit under both our arms
Picking out penny candy in the country store
Until we collapsed on the porch with our bellies sore

So what's it like to be on your own
A roamin' vagabond
Away from home in search of some forgotten door
Is it half as good as it sounds

And tell me have you really found
The peace and calm we've all been lookin' for
Freckles still misses you, she always sleeps on the floor in your room
Ruth says she smells but you know it's just her very unique perfume

The tree in the back bore apples but they're green and full of worms
I guess we'll sit tight and wait until the cider turns
Everyone sends their love, they still don't really believe you're gone
Everyone's jealous of this crazy oddysey that you're on

Hoping this finds you happy and healthy and sane
Pray that your strength will ease you through the growing pains
So what's it like to be on your own
A roamin' vagabond

Away from home in search of some forgotten door
Is it half as good as it sounds

"Your love is wonderful, yeah
And I don't wanna lose you
So, baby, soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
 
Sleepless nights and lonely days are all that fill my head all of the time
But all I do is think about the way you make me feel 
'cause, baby, this love is so real, 
 
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
 
If I try to spend some time with you to make you happy, 
would you feel better?
And if I could, with you I would be forever, forever in love, so in love
Making love all through the night, we could hold each other tight
I can take away the pain if you would only let me
Just forget about the past 'cause I want to make it last
Baby, I apologize 'cause, boy, I really need you in my life
 
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
Soon as I get home I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do
 
Baby, if you give me just another chance, I can show you love
Promise I'll be true to you
Don't have to worry 'cause I'm gonna treat you right
Baby, I miss you, just wanna kiss you, hold you in my arms tonight
 
Soon as I get home, baby, I know what I gotta do 'cause 
I don't need no one but you",6
"There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control
Of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
 
But there, is a light
In the dark, and I feel its warmth
In my hands, and my heart
Why can't I hold on?
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
 
Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories, of a stolen place
Caught in the silence 
An echo lost in space
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
 
I watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, oh it always does
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away",5
"Oh! they say some people long ago
Were searching for a diff'rent tune
One that they could croon 
As only they can

They only had the rhythm so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what they had
And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

And then they nursed it, rehearsed it
And gave out the news
That the southland 
Gave birth to the blues!",5
"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",6
"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind
The summer wind
The summer wind",5

There is a goddess the natives call Bet-I-Cha

Whose lover left long ago
But others say she's the music
Of lover's hearts all aglow
She may be moonlight so bright
Or soft winds sighin' at night
No matter where you may find her
She's one part close to your heart

"See the tree how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big

I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted
It was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
It wouldn't die

Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart
I loved her so

I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago

It would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late
'Cause I would know

That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly
Late, late show

And Honey, I miss you
I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck

Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day

It was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And Honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could

Yes, one day while I wasn't home
When she was there and all alone
The angels came

Now all I have is memories
Of Honey and I wake up nights
And call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up

A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down in the flower bed
That Honey loved

See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big

I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted
It was just a twig

"Wagon train of lovin' moving slow
And I can see the peace pipe burning low
You criticize each little thing I do
But listen baby, I've got news for you

[Chorus]
There's too many chiefs and not enough Indians around this house
Baby I'm tired of this old game we play called cat and mouse
If you don't give just a little bit more
We're both gonna lose this race
Cause there's too many chiefs and not enough Indians around this place

Trouble on our happy hunting ground
Cause you keep stepping too far out of bounds
It's hard to run this reservation right
When you stay on the warpath day and night

[Chorus]

Look at all the things I have to do
To keep this tepee running just for you
Well time's are tough and wampum's hard to save
Just remember who's the squaw and who's the brave

"Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere
And I'm learning how to smile

The only time it rains, is to cool things for a while
But since I met you, I can't forget you
The rainbows are back in style

There's not a thing in the world that I'd rather do
Than just sit and stare at your face
You're so doggone pretty
That you made the world a whole lot happier place

Life's worth livin' and the love that you're givin'
Has made me feel this way
And the rainbows have chased the clouds away

Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere
And I'm learning how to smile

The only time it rains, is to cool things for a while
But since I met you, I can't forget you
The rainbows are back in style

Your name is like music
And I can't help singin' it over and over again
This happy feeling has got me thinkin' it's heaven I am livin' in

The love we share, puts the magic in the air
And every dream comes true
And the rainbows turn the sky to blue

Rainbows are gettin' back in style
There's sunshine everywhere
And I'm learning how to smile

The only time it rains is to cool things for a while
But since I met you, I can't forget you
The rainbows are back in style

But since I met you, I can't forget you
The rainbows are back in style",6
"Cause that old time feeling's still inside my heart

Well, I'm sorry but it took me by surprise
To be looking in those old familiar eyes
If I'm acting funny please don't turn away
Seeing you has brought me back to yesterday

Yes, you're looking at the fool who used to be
In another world where love was new to me
But I learned my lesson when I let you go
And there's one thing that I've wanted you to know

If that old time feelin' ever starts again
And you think about the way it might have been
Don't let yesterdays mistakes keep us apart
Cause that old time feelin's still inside my heart

If that old time feelin' ever starts again
And you think about the way it might have been
Don't let yesterdays mistakes keep us apart
Cause that old time feelin's still inside my heart

Inside my heart",6

But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning

Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window
And make believe you love me one more time

Those arms they aren't real but somehow I feel
If I just close my eyes then maybe it will last

A little band of gold for everyone to see
I'll tell the world when you'll marry me

Now that I know it's your love that's so true

Raindrops keep falling on my head

Crying's not for me, oh

From the letters that I write, they think I'm fine.

And by night I make the bars,
If only they could read between the lines!

I rode a freight train north to Detroit City.
After all these years,
I find that I've just been wastin' my time.

So I just think I'll take my foolish pride,
Put on a south bound freight and ride,
Goin' back to the love ones,
The ones I left waitin' so far behind.

Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
you hear him sing his plaintive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today)
If you're looking for a moral to this song
50 million monkeys can't be wrong
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(In Cuba his smiling face is welcome most anyplace)
(Peanuts they hear him cry)
(Peanuts they all reply)
(If you're looking for an early morning treat)
(Get some double jointed peanuts good to eat)
For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)
The merry twinkle in his eye
He's got a way that makes you buy
(Each morning) that whistle blows
(Are you more than I sell)
If an apple keeps the doctor from your door
Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more
(Peanuts) we'll meet again
This street again
We'll eat again
You Peanut Man, that peanut man's gone
(Peanut, peanut, peanut)",6
"You're as pretty as a picture
In your brand new evening gown
Within your eyes I see that starlight of old
With that smile a little bold
What a lovely lovely picture
You're my treasured work of art
And I'll always keep your picture
Locked in a room in my heart
You're as pretty as a picture
In your brand new evening gown
Within your eyes I see that starlight of old

You're my treasured work of art
And I'll always keep your picture

"Since you're gone I spend each lonely night
Dealing out the cards from left to right
And the queen of hearts is there to remind me
That I'm all alone just playing solitaire
Love was just another game for two
I see now that's all it meant to you
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle
Now I'm all alone just playing solitaire
In each romance there's an element of chance
The gamble to win or to lose
You play to win
Then you find you're playing in a game with no rules, just made for fools
Now the joker has the laugh on me
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly
And until you want to share that old feeling
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire
And until you want to share that old feeling
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire",6
"Somebody loves you, I want you to know
Longs to be near you where ever you go
Somebody loves you and right from the start
Happiness flew into someone's heart

Somebody loves you each hour of the day
When you're around dear or when you're away
Somebody loves you sweetheart, can't you see?
And that somebody is me

Somebody loves you each hour of the day
When you're around dear or when you're away
Somebody loves you sweetheart, can't you see?
And that somebody is me
Oh yeah, and that somebody is me",7
"I'd work for you, I'd slave for you
I'd be a beggar or knave for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real things comes along
I'd gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love dear and it's worth to you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real things comes along
With all the words dear at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darlin', come what may
My heart is yours what more can I say
I'd sigh for you oh I'll cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
With all the words dear at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darlin', come what may
My heart is yours what more can I say
I'd sigh for you and I'll cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky for you
If that ain't love, it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
Until the real thing comes along
Until the real thing comes along",7

"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always stayed 
Beneath my feet before
All at once am I
Several stories high,
Knowing I'm on the street where you live

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it's just on the street where you live

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear

People stop and stare
They don't bother me,
For there's no where else on earth
That I would rather be

Let the time go by,
I won't care if I
Can be here on the street where you live

You I need
Not only merely I'm clearly a person bereft
Yes indeed
I'd draw the curtain for certain if you ever left
And if I stammer
Forgive my grammar
You got me winging, no wonder I'm singing
It's you I love

And the ocean's roar becomes a lullaby

Can in April bring blossoms to the vine

You're the one I've been living for

People used to call me nobody's baby
'Til they saw me with you
Walking in a day dream
Hoping that maybe all my dreams would come true

I planned every move and I tried hard to prove
That even a loser can win
I don't have a knack
My lonely is back

And I'm nobody's baby again
Nobody's baby again
I keep missing you more and more
Nobody's baby again

You're the one I've been living for I planned every move and I tried hard to prove
That even a loser can win
I don't have a knack
My lonely is back

Nobody's baby
Nobody's baby",6

Strette como e` tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma

Though there's grining and mandolining in sunny italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and that's one too few
On an evening in Roma

Don't know what the country's coming to
But in rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evening in Roma
On an evening in Roma

We don't need a heavenly setting
We don't need a sleepy lagoon

What a situation?
Just the three of us
Plus a natural inclination

We don't need flowery season
Love is love December or June
We can make our own weather
Just put us together
Me 'n' you 'n' the moon

We don't need a comfortable parlor
We don't need the nightingale's tune
All we need to get going
Is you 'n' me 'n' the moon

We don't need a horse and a buggy
Buggy rides are over too soon
All we need to get going
Is me 'n' you 'n' the moon

They've been able to show
There's a way to make rain and snow

No you can't love 'em all

And suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

And now I live in a world without sunshine
Ohh, I wish you were here

Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive

Last night I dreamed that you came to our house
To take an old book from the shelf
If you'll open the shutters I'll tear down the boards
Cause I drove every nail by myself

Shutters and boards cover the windows of the house
Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive

Where we used to live
All I have left is a heart full of sorrow
Since she said she'd never forgive

There's a rendezvous I keep
And the dreams I always meet help me forget we're far apart
I don't know exactly when dear
But I'm sure we'll meet again dear
And my darling 'til we do

Someone is sharing my memories
Wonder does she grieve
Every lovely evening

Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""
And she sighed: ""Si, Si""

Because we're far apart
Many moons had passed away
And still she's in my heart

In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
 
Somehow I keep on remembering
Tears that said goodbye
Shining in her eye
Wonder does she keep remembering
Promises of mine
When the moon is shining
 
In a little Spanish town
'Twas on a night like this
Stars were peek-a-booing down
'Twas on a night like this
I whispered ""Be true to me""

All they got is romance

Every lover's in a trance

Every couple's got a bench kissing shamelessly
Night and day they're making music
While they're making love in French

Make a true Parisian shrink
Wine is all he'll ever drink

And it worries me
For with wine as cheap as water
Oh it makes one stop and think

Had the craziest love affair
And the day after they parted there
He cries bitterly

But he brought his new girl Claire

Not unless you want romance

And now that I wander
My thoughts ever stray

Just for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face
It was fiesta we were so gay

South of the border down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered manana
Never dreamed that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered manana

For tomorrow never came
South of the border I jumped backed one day

You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls and little boys

May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But 'til it's January
I'll just go and disappear

Oh, Santa may have brought you some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged tinsel covered Christmas blues

Oh, Santa may have brought you some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged tinsel covered Christmas blues",7
"It's a marshmallow world in the winter
When the snow comes to cover the ground
It's time for play, it's a whipped cream day
I wait for it the whole year 'round

Those are marshmallow clouds being friendly
In the arms of the evergreen trees
And the sun is red, like a pumpkin head
It's shining so your nose won't freeze

Oh, the world is your snowball, see how it grows
That's how it goes, whenever it snows
The world is your snowball just for a song
Get out and roll it along

Oh, it's a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts
Take a walk with your favorite girl
It's a sugar date, what if spring is late
In winter it's a marshmallow world

"Buona sera, signorina, buona sera
It is time to say goodnight to Napoli
Though it's hard for us to whisper buona sera
With that old moon above the Mediterranean sea

In the morning, signorina, we'll go walking
Where the mountains help the moon come in to sight
And by the little jewelry shop we'll stop and linger
While I'll buy a wedding ring for your finger

In the meantime let me tell you that I love you
Buona sera, signorina, kiss me goodnight

"How do you speak to an angel
I'm completely in the dark
When you know that you've just met an angel
Is there a proper remark
We were alone for a moment
Why was I lost in a cloud
Do you speak to an angel in a whisper
Or do you just say I love you out loud

"Folks love to talk of the good, good old days
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Well, they say it was better in oh, so many ways
Long, long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
And on a very cold and wintery night
They couldn't sit and watch a TV fight

And when the summer came
They will have to take a dame all bundled up to the beach
They didn't know a girl could look so cute in a bikini suit

Oh, how they sing of the good, good old days
Long, long ago, long, long ago
They couldn't swing in the good, good old days
Long long ago, long ago

They couldn't go to a movie show, listen to the radio, go for a ride in a car
(But they still talk of the good, good old days)
And on a very cold and wintery night

I don't believe that it's so

I look at her and I say to myself
There's my lover
Just imagine she comes running to me
For love

I feel so proud I could shout to the crowd

Those are the lips that kiss me
Those are the arms that hold me
Those loving hands caress me
Oh, but the Fates have blessed me

There is my first love, my last love, my all
There's my lover

"Here we are out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning
Look how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Here we are in the cozy chair
Picking on a wishbone from the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Father did not like you at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest

Well, here we are just above the Seine
Foggy little fella,drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say goodnight

Better better than a dream
What is real is more ideal than a dream
To see and hear you to be so near you is better better than a dream

Can this be a dream
Can I still be asleep on the couch there
Can this girl be really here
She seems to know by sheer intuition how I landed in this condition
Or does she know me the way I think the way that I drink the fact that I slept all year
But it's not a dream 'cause look I've got some words on the paper
Steady boy don't faint or scream
Don't ask who sent you this angel it's better better than a dream",7

I can't hold out I've been sold out
By the thrills I found locked in your arms

The moment that our eyes met I realized
Another moment more and I'd be hypnotized
I tried to turn away from your eyes but your eyes held me fast
And I'm captured yes I'm captured
There is nothing I can do
I can't back track there's no track back
I am yours heaven open it's doors

And while we keep going, the breezes are blowing
The cigarette smoke from our eyes

You'll hear beautiful melodies played by an old water mill
And a little red barn is spinning a yarn to the daffodils up on the hill
Oh, there's nothing as gay as a day in the country

We warble a merry old song

As she pass she flashed that come-hither look
The look
That was meant for me and for me alone

The look
Would be out of place in a children's book
The look
That could chip a piece off a heart of stone

Consider a bit this interesting little tableau
A look I could read but where would it lead me to
But mischievous elf I labeled myself diablo
And did just exactly what she was sure I'd do
Now at her beck and call
She ties me to the strings of her Spanish shawl
That isn't all
One foot out the door and she gives me the look

I say goodbye now she puts her foot down
I'm flying high now that's when I'm put down
I want to die now she puts her foot down
Freezes me with the look

Someday if she sashays by you and looks your way
I'd say you'll do well if you overlook the look
The look

I wish I had you back again

The common cold, the heartburn and the heartache

And your diamond-studded world

So, get your whip and do your thing
And I'll run around the ring
Ride my white horse, wear my armor too

Ah, but I don't easy blister, babe
I'll be your court jester, babe

You had me strugglin' for a time
A draggin' on your line

Study your style
Come out a whole lot wiser man indeed

As you appeared and looked around
Found the grandest star up in the East

Just a little girl with a lot of gold
Want one more trinket for her golden scene

Hair that's lost some of its beauty
By too many hours in the sun

Eyes that show some disappointment
And there's been quite a lot in my life
She's the foundation I lean on
My woman, my woman, my wife

Everyday has been uphill
We climb but we can't reach the top
I'm weak and I'm easily discouraged
She just smiles when I wanna stop

Lips that are weary but tender
With love that strengthens my life
Saint in a dress made of gingham
My woman, my woman, my wife

Two little babies were born in the spring
But died when the winter was new
I lost control in my mind and my soul
But my woman's faith carried us through

When she reaches that river
Lord, you know what she's worth
Give her that mansion up yonder
'Cause she's been through hell here on earth

Lord, give her my share of Heaven
If I've earned any here in this life
'Cause God, I believe she deserves it

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead
Detour, paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

When I got right to the place where it said about face
I thought that all my worries were behind
But the farther I go the more sorrow I know
Should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead
Detour, paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

Didn't have the way of how to get
From the hole that I'm in yet
Should have read that detour sign

Detour, there's a muddy road ahead
Detour, paid no mind to what it said
Detour, oh, these bitter things I find

"And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says ""Hi""
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school, goodbye

She reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says, ""How you feeling hon?""
And I look across at smiling lips
That warm my heart and see my morning sun

And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say

God didn't make a little green apples
It don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
No such thing as Doctor Seuss
Disneyland or Mother Goose is no nursery rhyme

God didn't make a little green apples
And it ain't gonna rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
When myself is feelin' low
Think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask if she could get away and meet me and grab a bite to eat
Then she drops what she's doin' and hurries down to meet me
And I'm always late but she sits waitin' patiently
And smiles when she first sees me 'cause she's made that way

And if that's not lovin' me then all I've got to say

God didn't make a little green apples
It don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
There's no such think as make believe
Puppy dogs and autumn leaves and BB guns

God didn't make a little green apples
And it ain't gonna rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
When myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
To ease my mind, to ease my mind",5

No one to tell your troubles to

And not a true friend can be found

You'll find I'll never change
Through the sunshine and the shadows
I'll always be the same

And the flowers and the trees
The moon up above, and the thing called love

Let me tell you 'bout the stars in the sky

It's very plain to see
That it's time you learn about the facts in life

Every minute one more thrill,
Every hour it grows stronger

I live for tomorrow
For I know what's in store,
I can be sure that tomorrow
Will be sweeter than before.

I'll do all that's in my power
Just to keep the old ways new,
Every minute every hour
I'll spend loving you.

Every minute every hour
I'll spend loving you",7

Some can't go the distance, they're only good in sprints

I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling

Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow

Every road has a turning

I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning

For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals

That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see

Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals

That old gang of mine

There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals

Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",6
"Think about me whenever you're lonely
Think about me whenever you're blue
Think about me when you have heartaches

I'll be a waitin' for eternity waitin' for you to return to me

Back it up and stop on yesterday
Back to before that silly fight
And give me a chance to make things right

I said some things I didn't mean to
Say things that I am sorry for today
Down on my knees I beg you
Please to turn the world around the other way

I never really wanted us to break up
And I'm sorry for each teardrop that you've cried
We need to give our hearts a chance to make up
And darling will you stand in by my side

We'll turn the world around the other way
Back to where it started yesterday
Just take my hand, together
We can turn the world around the other way

Turn the world around the other way
Back it up and stop on yesterday
Just take my hand, together
We can turn the world around the other way

Yes, turn the world around the other way",4
"When it's twilight on the trail and I jump along
The world is like a dream and the ripple of the stream is my song
When it's twilight on the trail and I rest once more
My ceiling is the sky and the grass on which I lie is my floor

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means
Guess, I was born, born that way

When it's twilight on the trail and my voice is still
Please plant this heart of mine
Underneath that lonesome pine on the hill

Never ever have a nickel in my jeans
Never ever have a debt to pay
Still I understand what real contentment means
Guess, I was born that way

When it's twilight on the trail and my voice is still
Please, plant this heart of mine
Underneath that lonesome pine on the hill",7

There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral,

Empty saddles in the old corral,
Where do ya ride tonight?
Are ya roundin' up the dogies,
The strays of long ago,
Are ya on the trail of buffalo?
Empty saddles in the old corral,
Where do ya ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border,
Or a band of Navajo
Are ya headin' for the Alamo?
Empty guns covered with rust
Where do ya talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do ya walk tonight?
Empty saddles in the old corral,
My tears would be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely,
As ya carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corral

There is no smoke, still the fires burn,
There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return
Softly to vanish through the bars

That's the story of,
That's the glory of love

We've got the world and all its charms
And when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You've got to win a little, lose a little

That's the story of,
That's the glory of love.",5

Oh I can see you there
With loving tears in your eyes

And some day we'll find this where and when

Traveling higher than heaven's door
Locked in your sweet embrace

Look at the happiness going around

Look at the drummer entertaining the gang
Clinging and clanging with a bing and a bang

Changing the town from dead to alive

Knock on wood as well I should
For all that you're making of me
Never thought you'd love me

And ask them all what's new
They join me in the answer,darling, it's you

Because I'm in love

That fall from above

The trees are bare
But I can feel the scent of roses in the air
It's June in January
Because I'm in love
But only because I'm in love with you

My mother will start to worry (beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (listen to the fireplace roar)

Say what's in this drink? (no cabs to be had out there)

I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (i'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say, no, no, no sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)

Italians love to sip a cup of cappuccino
And listen to the man who plays the mandolino
You offer him a cigarette a glass of wine
That's how he's paid to serenade your lady fair

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win

He seems like such a happy man, the man who plays the mandolino
He sings a song of sweet romance for all the lovers as they dance
But all he's holding in his arms is just a little mandolino
He has no woman of his own so every night he walks alone

With his little mandolino
And a twinkle in his eye
Senoritas he can win
Always for another guy

(And while he's strumming songs of love the man who plays the mandolino)
(His eyes are always looking for a senorina to adore)
He drinks a toast to his true love each time he lifts a glass of vino

Please turn me loose
What's the use

Let me go lover
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go",5

"Here we sit enjoying the shade
Hey brother, pour the wine
Drink the drink that I have made
Hey brother, pour the wine

Tell you why the day is sunny
I'm in love with lips of honey
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother, pour the wine

She is coming here to stay
Hey brother, pour the wine
I have waited for the day
Hey brother, pour the wine

She writes of love in every letter
Others have tried but I will get her
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother, pour the wine

What is life? what is spring?
What are all the stars that shine?
Love, my friend is everything
And love will soon be mine

Pour it as quickly as you can
Hey brother, pour the wine
Pour it quickly once again
Hey brother, pour the wine

She's here at last my one and only
Goodbye friends and don't be lonely
Wait 'til you see the way she walks
Hey brother, pour the wine

Blink your eyes and love has passed
Hey brother, pour the wine
Her's was never made to last
Hey brother, pour the wine

She introduced me to another
No my friends, he's not her brother
I will miss the way she walks
Hey brother, pour the wine

Pour the wine, pour the wine
Hey brother, pour the wine
Pour the wine",6
"Volare, oh oh
Cantare, oh oh oh oh
Let's fly way up to the clouds
Away from the maddening crowds
We can sing in the glow of a star that I know of
Where lovers enjoy peace of mind
Let us leave the confusion and all disillusion behind
Just like bird of a feather, a rainbow together we'll find

Volare, oh oh
E contare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai piu
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia di blu
Poi d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito

Volare, oh oh
E contare, oh oh oh oh
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassu
E volavo, volavo felice piu in alto del sole ed ancora piu su
Mentre il mondo pian piano spariva lontano laggiu
Una musica dolce suonava soltanto per me

Volare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Nel blu, dipinto di blu
Felice di stare lassu",7

Promise her anything but give her love
You may not be a rich man but you don't need wealth or fame

Promise her bracelets of silver and jade
Promise her servants a butler and maid

"[Background chorus]
(Peanut do bop do bop)
(Peanut do bop do bop)

In Cuba each merry maid wakes up with this serenade
Peanuts (they're nice and hot)
Peanuts (he sells a lot)
Peanuts
If you haven't got bananas don't be blue
Peanuts in a little bag are calling you
Don't waste them (no tummy ache)
You'll taste them (when you're awake)
For at the very break of day
The peanut vendor's on his way
At dawning the whistle blows
(through every city, town and country lane
you hear him sing his plaintive little strain)
And as he goes by to you he'll say
(Big jumbos) big jumbo ones
(Come buy those) peanuts roasted today
(Come buy those freshly roasted today)
If you're looking for a moral to this song
50 million monkeys can't be wrong
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(Peanuts do bop do bop)
(In Cuba his smiling face is welcome most anyplace)
(Peanuts they hear him cry)
(Peanuts they all reply)
(If you're looking for an early morning treat)
(Get some double jointed peanuts good to eat)
For breakfast (or dinnertime)
For supper (most anytime)
The merry twinkle in his eye
He's got a way that makes you buy
(Each morning) that whistle blows
(Are you more than I sell)
If an apple keeps the doctor from your door
Peanuts ought to keep him from you even more
(Peanuts) we'll meet again
This street again
We'll eat again
You Peanut Man, that peanut man's gone
(Peanut, peanut, peanut)",6
"Your sweet expression the smile you gave me
The way you looked when we met
It's easy to remember so hard to forget
I hear you whisper I always love you
I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember but oh so hard to forget
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight
I'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling stealing through the night
Each little moment is clear before me
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget
So I must dream to have your hand caress me fingers press me tight
I'd rather dream than have that lonely old feeling stealing through the night
Each little moment is clear before me
And though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember and so hard to forget",5
"Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare
Sotto il cielo di Roma

Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm a girl I wish I knew
On an evning in Roma

Though there's grining and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun when the sun goes down
So please meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and one is one too few
On an evening in Roma

Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome do as the Romans do
Will you on an evening in Roma

Como e' bella ce' la luna brille e' strette
Strette como e' tutta bella a passeggiare

That we have found a feeling higher than high
My own, my only, my all

Kindled by your kiss the warmth of your embrace
The luster of a love-light lighting your face
My own, my only, my all

Knock on wood as well I should
For all that you're making of me
Never thought you'd love me
But you do you do

And when I look up at the stars
And ask them all what's new
They join me in the answer Darling it's you
My own, my only, my all

Knock on wood as well I should
For all that you're making of me
Never thought you'd love me

"I'm praying for rain in California
So the grapes can grow and they can make more wine
And I'm sitting in a honky in Chicago
With a broken heart and a woman on my mind

I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
And they asked who's the fool in the corner crying
I say, a little ole wine drinker me

I came here last week from down in Nashville
Cause my baby left for Florida on a train
I thought I'd get a job and just forget her
But in Chicago, the broken heart is still the same

I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
When they ask, who's the fool in the corner crying
I say, a little ole wine drinker me
I say, a little ole wine drinker me",4
"I'm sinking like a resting stone.
With demons in my head.
I feel you from my skin to bone, 
With darkness in the air.

Chasing down your silhouettes, 
I find there's nothing left.
Facing down a lonely road, 
Into the pure unknown.  
But I'll keep coming back!

You can steel my mind, 
Twist it for a while,
But you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track, but I'll keep coming back.

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track, 
But I'll keep coming,

Streets of heaven never had a name.
I found my own way there.
I know I'm bound to lose my way again, 
Cause love and war is never fair.

Facing down a lonely road,
Into the pure unknown.
But I'll keep coming back!

You can steel my mind, 
twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack, 
Throw me way off track,
But I'll keep coming back!

Take my mind to rest!

twist it for a while, 
but you can't take my pride.
You can watch me crack,
Throw me way off track,
But I'll keep coming back!

On this, our weddin' day
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

And I must face a man who hates me
Or lie a coward, a craven coward
Or lie a coward in my grave

Oh, to be torn 'twixt love and duty
S'posin' I lose my fair-haired beauty
Look at that big hand move along
Nearin' high noon

He made a vow while in state prison
Vowed it would be my life or his'n
I'm not afraid of death but oh
What will I do if you leave me?

Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'
You made that promise as a bride
Do not forsake me, oh my darlin'

Now that I need you by my side

For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.
But when the sun goes down
And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.
I know you've forsaken me,
Till the shadows fall.
But then once again
I can dream,
I've the right
To be close to you
All through the night.",6

For always I hold your hand
For always be your man, be your man

"Found myself just the other day
In the backyard of a friends place
Thinking about you
Thinking of the crowd you're in,
What you're up to, where you've been,
Just thinking

You know the clothes that you wear and the color in your hair
Shouldn't change you
Now you tell me why is it so,
You're bigger than Mighty Joe

At least you think so

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

Threw my smoke down on the ground
Turned my head and I heard the sound that reminded me
Of the days so young and sweet
Always so much fun to me,

At least I thought so

Now you think you're so damn fine,
You could rule the world,
No not mine,
I don't think so

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

You know the scene that you're in and the people that you've been with
Just get to me
But you think I'm not as cool
As you are so beautiful,
Who you foolin'?

Well I'm here to tell you babe the game you're in is just a game, so damn pretentious

God my fingers burn,
Now when I think of touching your hair
You have changed so much that I don't know if I can call you and tell you I care
And I would love to bring you down, plant your feet back on the ground

You think you're so beautiful, so beautiful",6

Takes me back to the other place
When I feel it's not too far away
And I just want to hold your hand and walk with you on another day

I want you to sit on my lap 
And do the sweet things 
That we used to

At the place just the other day
And I ordered a drink the tonics on its way
When I feel it's not too far away
And I just want to hold your hand and walk with you on another day

I want you to sit on my lap

If you wanna know your name
Be your friends
And if you ever want to pay

It's hard to know how far you go

All of this place

Right down on you
If you change what you say

And if you wanna hide yourself
Be the one

"First time that I saw your face
I was blown away without a trace
I felt so alone on a busy street
When you passed me by
I felt my feet melt away
Melt away

I pray to God that I could meet
Somebody like the girl that I'd just seen
Someone that can stop me dead
Someone that will spin round, in my head, all day
In my head, all day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you

That night I saw her again
Was the first time I touched her hand
She made me feel so warm
We talked all night, til the dawn came our way
Til the dawn came our way

But the timing was all wrong
When I met the one, I should've known
Instead I walked away
Leaving behind my destiny on that day
My destiny on that day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you

But I still see her face
In my mind, it's the only place
And we will meet again
And I will touch your hand again, on that day
Your hand again, on that day

Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you
Someday I will fly with you",7

And it slowly goes from black then into white
I know if you watch the time
Leaves you standing for a moment in life

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

So I wait to seize the day
With a clouded mind
And a hell of a load to pay
I find that if you know your way
You'll get out of this mess

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

I know there comes a time
To believe in yourself
And grow in confidence
Stop hiding behind the door
Like everyone else
Just get out and do your best

I know I've been through black and white
I know I'll put up a fierce fight
I know I lost my soul
I know that I lost my soul

I know that I'll find my soul",5

Your flowers drowning in some bitter tea

Find your mirror go and look inside
And see the talent you always hide

Satisfaction's not far away

Hold on now your exit's here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Your coffee's warm but your milk is sour
Life is short but your here to flower
Dream yourself along another day
Never miss opportunity

Don't be scared of what you cannot see
Your only fear is possibility
Never wonder what the hell went wrong
Your second chance may never come along

Hold on now your exits here
It's waiting just for you
Don't pause too long
It's fading now
It's ending all too soon you'll see

Soon you'll see

Hold on now your exits here

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?",5
"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

The sky was blue
And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I'm so lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me
When I remember every little thing

You used to do
I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

The sky is blue
The  night is cold
The moon is new
But love is old
And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover come back to me",5
"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",6
"I saw your face in a riot picture
In your eyes I could feel the friction
Once again, I want some of your attention
In for a split second

Turn a pacifist into art
Turn a communist into sharing bombs
Turn me inside out

You're my girl in a uniform
My girl in a uniform
I throw stones from the balcony
Throwing rocks at the embassy
I'm gonna give my body and soul
My girl in a uniform

Sweet taste of a guilty pleasure
Tied down, I can feel depression
A scorning voice on the coldest defeat
Oh, you knock me off my feet
Turn me inside out

You're my girl in a uniform
My girl in a uniform
I throw stones from the balcony
Throwing rocks at the embassy
I'm gonna give my body and soul
My girl in a uniform

For you, I lose control 
For you, I lose control 

Too much to (?) it's pretty sore
Too out of reach in to waging war
Go down like an atrocity
For a girl in a uniform
A burst of telepathy
For a girl in a uniform
For you, I lose control

You're my girl in a uniform
My girl in a uniform
I throw stones from the balcony
Throwing rocks at the embassy
I'm gonna give my body and soul
My girl in a uniform

For you, I lose control",5

Across the sand so I may keep

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

P.H. the next man not in da plans
I`m dead serious like as in response I hit niggaz in the head
P.R. the thoroughbred comes through intellectual
I rap lyrical, always on da humble and sometimes I`m spiritual
Hands down accept any mans challenge
I strive and keep the competition off balance
Da fruits of my talent is this it`s simple
I drop science on the instrumental
I take seven ill drums put `em in a line
And add seven more snares to make it combine
It`ll take seven more horns before I start to rhyme
Now that twenty-one beats made up at the same time
I was bound ta shine haters get left behind
Ain`t no time for them, stamp my name on rap
Perhaps you hear da words from pay next sequel
Part two something for tha people
I`m still number one

Now I appear return ten years the pioneer
Deliver action thrillers that explode in ya ear
Compensate for all the ups and downs in my career
Stop the small talk my focus remains clear
Should have won a Nobel prize for thoughts and ideas
Critically acclaimed while some of y`all cats in tha game for fame
Fame lives in my name Pete Rock it`s simple and plain
Check it simply stressing it soon to start chin checking kids
God protected, so I`m selected to orchestrate the next great
And create, contemplate the world`s fate P.R. the heavyweight
Put these thoughts in ya mind while we on the topic
You can tell I`m still on it by the way I rock it
Full swing introduce the ninety-eight product
Niggaz talk the gossip but they ain`t got shit
I`m number one

This goes out to deejays and emcees
Unlock real hip-hop, Rock holds the key
Magnificent ya style is irrelevant
I`ll flip the bass and erase any trace of sample evidence
Trust a few men within this circle of thieves
Single out the enemy with ease
Earned every stripe on my sleeve
The five star general keep it moving ya rap needs improvement
So here`s a lesson ta learn, lyrics under fire burn third degree
And my steez is making hot tracks for G`s
World famous, salute my capabilities with 21 guns and ammunition
The SP runs 91 rounds precision on target with this rap bullet
First string team in position
The medal of honor hanging from my neck swinging
I`m still number one",5

"From the basics and warm, weather places
Dedicated to the brothers that never made it
Cut short, they prime read life between the lines
Photographed by rhymes yo it's hard times
All across the nation cold points of frustration
Created hot joints of illustration
Concentrate while stakes are high falling victim to the lie
Keep a sharp eye there's a steady supply of hate in the air
To them cats who stare the ice grill with the glare
But everything is fair in the city the sheisty the shiftee
I'n the epitomee of a raw deal now carry a sword and shield
And walk with a forcefield for real I overcame the odds
And got the hell out of dodge soul survivor of the war
And master in charge

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live nigga keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

I watched the whole world from the side of my eye
I seen a lot of cats die and evil men lie
On the road to riches in pursuit of my wishes
It's a close call between friends and snitches
On the low the game brought moments of pain
Strong emotions plus the hardships of fame
No need to live forever just keep some type of cheddar
A buttersoft leather to rock in cold weather
Times are mad real official like the seal
Try to understand what I feel
My word to the wise it's where ya heart lies
Keep your biz straight far from family ties
I'm the illest soldier that represents the culture
Dignified bywords like fresh, fly and ultra
Champion heroics and passionate poets
Flashback to the future let it self focus

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But beautiful black sisters keep risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

Still in basement for four years arranging
Lyrics and beats my first lote engagement
It's outstanding the boy wonder's back in the world
By popular demanding on top commanding
My own destiny go ahead try to test me
I been living right so expect no less g
Got positive reaction and affirmative action
The soul survivor guaranteed satisfaction

Everyday I see the same ol' things
But my true and real live people keep on risin
And it's a shame but business never changes
And my crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die...

And if I die before I wake I pray go God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving
And if I die before I wake I pray to God my soul to take
My crew knows what to do they're soul surviving

Went on to create and perfect the unexpected

 Her ass was kinda phat so she moved me yo 
 When I scoped out her mental was straight said let's roll 
 Stared this shorty everynight and everyday 
 On the rebound around left right and hey 
 I'm a critical brother when it comes down to broads 
 But this wop here is like the Grammy Awards 
 Had style and grace and class a lot of taste 
 On a slow dance we romance around my place 
 Like a king from queens is how she made me feel 
 And if I did dirt it was locked and sealed 
 No doubt was all about me and my love thing 
 If the phone called Paul I was lettin it ring 
 Absolutely, she looped me the hook was good 
 Niggaz buggin on me buggin in my neighbor hood 
 Yeah boss, but on course is my game plan and 
 Shorty wop keep me chillin with the name brand 
 Kicks and whips, going all out chicks, flicks and tours

 You might get snapped, caught in the trap 
 Sneekin bout a cheese stack so sewer that and ease back

 Both of us together we bomb makers bottles of Dom breakers 
 Many mansions on farm acres pushin porches with four doors 
 Diamonds with no flaws with the pretty mamas 
 on beaches of Bahama shores 
 Pinky ring is like a stone age without the dinosaurs 
 Comin from me G Rap yo, truly yours",5
"Introducing c.l. then face defeats
Then I remind you of third street when it was sweet
See'd us move on and grow to another plateau with me and ....
Havin that dough
In the last days when critical times are left
To deal with my grand daddy's endeavors
Whut corrected my errors the first shot came in 91
E.p. done my struggle
To label this untouchable foundation due in 92 top ten review
Respect new when that flew they reminisce over you
Had marie too, sporting my nike's at the door
Paper saw the main ingredient l.p. in 94
Now it's me the bold coppin toys for dolo
At ease he'd rather die at his feet than live on his knees
Don't mistake the forest for trees
Off course why try and climb a mountain
A baby walk across in tha military mindset place ya bet
Ya fumbled all those chicks with the bucks off safety
Skirt chasin what they rate me in this whole rap affair
Butwhen it really comes down to it who cares
Like the tortiosse and the hare ya know the race I run
But ya losin all the nights, let the rabbit get the gun
Number one wit a bullet and pit named black
It's the best that ever did it on a pete rock track

Aye yo two cool cats who reclaim the name
Pete rock and c.l. smooth in this here rap game
But the good news is that there is a crew
Not 5 not 4 not 3 da two

In tha beginning let it be like the record spinning
As a child I stack 45's in a pile blow the dust off
Put it on before I can walk
Play static on my pop dukes automatic
I knew I wasn't average music in my bloodstream
My pops watch his son live his dream
Now as time flew the original classy rock crew
Shine through on streets and avenues
The next chapter you read it mc shan said it
Got ta give the man behind wheels credit
Yes yes y'all bls and marley marl
The rap attack put my talents on the map
Now it's pete rock for days in tha basement
As I amaze watch me blow in 98 ways
I specialize in rap dj and produce wit more
Hot tracks then carlos dejesus

Chorus 2x

What it look like ain't nothin changed but the weather
Still riding with c.d.'s and leather roll fives and better
For all that's folded in ya pocket how long it take
To reup and clock it, drop and make a profit
And lay my position with you that we know what to do
And what not to do here's my crew now you get yours to bare witness
It's nothing personal it's business
That's my word which is my bond, behind writing ta step back
And watch it all tighten stop this fighting each other
God knowledge ya wis that ya know who the enemy is furthermore
Don't hide it divide it then x ya squares
To keep them other cats folded like beach chairs
Got an eye on that street aristocrat
Let c.l. show ya where the strengths at
Turn it up right here or just call the cop
'cause we on it like this to tha last stop
The next humprhev bogart mastering art
Like a jeweler wit a diamond cutter, take'em apart
Don't start whut ya can't finish
When ya bubble wit skills that never diminish
Ya best team against mine is a light scrimmage
So play like popeye and eat spinach

"[Big Pun] 
Yo, Terror Squad, Pete Rock collabo' 
From git-go, yo yo 

Aiyyo it's such a shame 
all these dick riders tryin to corrupt the game 
But what it bring, nuttin but pain 
and one in your fuckin brain 
Ain't nuttin changed since the album I'm still whylin 
I'm still violent I've been waitin for this moment 
like Phil Collins, for all my life I've been trifer than trifer 
Hyper than hype, when fightin to fight 
It's like, tonight is the night 
And I ain't even tryin to let a nigga slide 
I've been dyin to get a gat 
I dared to try now prepare to die 
I rush your crib like Jehovah's Witness, blow up any 
soldiers, infants, hold up, did you notice my heroic entrance? 
I'm so relentless in this field of rap, everything is real in fact 
Fully backed by bullies who be peelin caps 
I sack the rapper like li-nebacker, play my rhyme backwards 
you can hear the Devil speak his mind with fine graphics 
Things get drastic, Express for my plastic 
I pack clips, between my nuts and my fat dick 

[Chorus: Pete Rock] 
Grab ahold cause you never heard a 
verbal murder like this 
Cash comes before soul, so watch your shit 
Every cat want to be enormous 
Plottin on the next one 
Murder one (repeat 2X) 

[Noreaga] 
Aiyyo my whole circle, make you feel it like The Color Purple 
My niggaz comin through and still hurt you 
Wipe why'all Kleenex cats who stay full of germs 
We hit Fifth Ave, while why'all still hit Stern's 
Don't really care bout why'all, really hear bout why'all 
Yo on our side we do our thing, play the cut 
let the phone ring, Pete Rock connect team 
From M-V to L-see, my thugs straight thuggin it 
Snatchin niggaz out of the booth, unpluggin it 
Strange Fruit, my niggaz live to shoot 
Yo it's a strange thing, a nigga never had a suit 
Yo so bust what happen, remember the unknown's a clap-man 
Cat stackin, move out the hood that's in Manhattan 
Got big headed, misleaded, then dreaded 
Yo the beef deaded, his whole squad afraid to set it 
Yo I heard son, son is rockin iceberg Dunn 
Got up out the hood, wouldn't believe that, this cat would 
Head mad swollen, flamboyant this man golden 
Yo the Senator, crime sinister, John Dillinger 
Better respect my words or I'm the minister

Yo, we just begun the story, Com Pun and Nore 
Look to the sun for glory as time runs before me 
I'm after the day of judgment I'm still before the 
jury, explainin why I was in a gun orgy 
He was FUCKIN wit me, I ain't no duckin emcee 
With the knowledge there's a little thug blood in me 
This stud bumped into me, beef it was fin' to be 
My Appetite for Destruction is finnicky 
He was an industry type, influenced by magazines and snipes 
Rocked Adidas but he had no stripes 
I could tell in high school that he had no fights 
Hold dick better than he hold mics, he spiked his punchlines 
with current events, called for backup 
like one time when he heard it was Sense 
that deliver words with intents to kill 
Whether the hip-hop type, country rapper, or big wheel 
I peeled some raps back, that peeled his cap back 
Fucker thought I was Abstract, now his life is backtracked 
In the center of the party his crew identified the body 
Left him signin the wait-list sayin, ""I can't take this 
fake shit"" (echoes) 

Yo.. 
Yo!

""Sucka MC's please think twice"" -> Special Ed - Think About It

[Verse 1: Grap Luva]
Who'll be the sucka MC to get dismantled
I hope that you can handle your whipness or sees ya flippin gettin
Down with my lazy boy laidback style of speak
The funk makes you dance cheek to cheek
I be the black civilian who is bound to make a million
Or make enough loot so I can buy my own provillian
Throw a fat party and invite everybody
And play all the old school hits like Lodi Dodi
Connections like OPEC while ya hung up like a Kojak
I'm real like a ruby while ya fake like a pinchback
That's imitation gold if you didn't know
My rhymes flow as my vocab' grows and grows
I freak it for the basslines always walkin on ya frontline
Catch me while I'm boomin' in ya alkine
Yo I'm out like a shot from a tec
You need to think twice just to earn respect, so

[Chorus: Pete Rock](5X)
""Sucka MC's please think twice
You don't know what you doin'
Think about that"" 	-> Special Ed - Think About It

[Verse 2: Pete Rock]
Aiiyo, as I come through for '95 with the flav'
So amazin' the Boy Wonder's blazin'
Respect the mic check, one, two
Cause I display the funk material as I stand imperial
To others, gotta lay low, undercover
Cats flow to the hands for the crowd in the stands
So here I am, plus I rock to please the public
They want it, word son, they want it
To hear the Soul Brother disperse words of wisdom
When InI comin' direct on the set
So represent, a lot of rap niggaz came to win
But the style played out when they chose a different route
Whatever as I stay true to the game
Word to the troubled T-Roy you know my name
Keep an eye on the stakes as I watch my back
Think Twice before you try to grab the mic and react

[Chorus](5X)
[Verse 3: Rob-O]
Yo beg your pardon...
Whn I put one to the head now the funk shit startin'
Fine soul I headline for my public get mine
Yeah my rap subjects packed with potential
Plus the versatile elements to crush ya scent
I get down so cheer the mental
Rhyme-pro I'm Rob-O the super spectacular brown skin nigga from Africa
Blowin' up so it's impossible to get
With the highlight and fly right and the niggaz on my dick
Split when it's through, gotta skip with the Guinness Crew
Give a shout out to my Uptown Crew, word up
From New York, New York the Big Apple
To the four square miles Uptown armed for battle
Your niggaz is nice but my advice is you can't suffice
So Think Twice, uhh

"Ain't no second time to appreciate
Ain't no second time to appreciate
Ain't no second time to appreciate
Ain't no second time to appreciate
Ain't no second time to appreciate

First of all, you better count your blessings
When you got C.L. now you got bad boy, your connections
In return, while we live and we learn then you know what it is
To only build a bigger future for the kids

In peace, in war, let's take it to the floor
Every time we take two steps the crowd takes four
Lay the heat, how I come to the street, how I cut through the beef
Let me handle that, that's why you make me chief

It's packed, what they want in this here
Can we weather the storm, six minutes, C.L. Smooth you're on
All the anger and the fear was in the dressing room prayer
That we came out to light it up and put it in the air

That's real, so holler back at ya boy, step aside Leroy
To all my ladies, who want tickets, enjoy
'Cause I spit it and you gotta get with it and you'll never forget it
Yes, I want the best out, count 'em all

Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us

Ain't no second time to appreciate
Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
When it all goes down, baby, all we got is us

You tell 'em this is history in the making, avoiding disasters
This run is for the green jacket, I fit the masters
My crew havin' business, save, put it in through my office
The security is tight and the secretary is gorgeous

That's official, me and Pete in the lab, that's what they want
Pushin' that real hip hop up to the front
The game's been good to me, preserved my youth
Not only did it capture my goals and told me the truth

Look out my hustle, made a living, paid and driven
See why they tour around the world came to save us from prison
It's great, I rather love than hate
You think it fell out the sky, I'm here to tell you, why believe in faith

Hard work payin' of and them wishes comin' true
Bolt open and you out to lunch and left us two
Now you know we can't let that pass to get that cash
We in the big numbers, count 'em all

Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us

Ain't no second time to appreciate
Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
When it all goes down, baby, all we got is us

Why my uncle doc left me everything when he died
And when pop passed, two weeks later I cried
And when great grandma left it all went crazy now
All I had left was grandma Pam, that's my baby

Can't talk bad about me, she tell 'em why we need to give her
All those roses while she could smell 'em
I live this moment used to stay how we was
How my mother came to her in a dream and told her

Corey will come out of this deep dark depression, stand by me
Give my insight a resurrection and heal me
And feel me, what you got is to love, got a thing
This little woman who brought back the thug, let's grind

Ghetto's of the mind while I'm in my prime
I left, so y'all can catch up, I'm ahead of my time
Your legacy and that lazy boy say it ain't fear
My next generation triple my digits, add 'em up like

Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the fans and to all my people that supported us
Ain't no second time to appreciate
To the mama and the daddy and everything they taught us

Ain't no second time to appreciate
Tell them kids they gotta stay in school or ride with us
Ain't no second time to appreciate

y'all don't want, beef
No y'all don't want, that

Word to my cousin, the truth and no lie
Me and my dawg was in his brand new Land, puffin' on lye
Tameka came by, glossy-eyed as she cried
Lil' Jay got sprayed with a chrome four-five

That's my motherfuckin' man, get in the Land
Head to the rest, grab vests, switch whips to the Caravan
I heard an ambulance right up the block
Plus more shots, the shit's gettin' hot, pull up and park

By the back, pass the gat, hit the lights and lay back
Hold up, now roll up, yo where them niggaz at?
I know one of them cats from the projects with Jay
The first nigga move, I'ma pull this gun, spray

No delay, we stay night to fuckin' dawn
It's on, my head spinnin', feelin' my cheeks get warm
Tears drip as I stepped out the whip
Slipped a clip, had to get hit, uh-uh that's that bullshit

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets

Yo, I can't believe my man since 3rd grade got sprayed
Bullet laced as he laid, chokin' up blood with no aid
Made money for the purpose of his daughter
Victim of an unmerciful slaughter, explain harder

Or don't bother, I'ma heat yo' ass like lava
Identified was that tinted gray Chevy Impala
Fleein' the scene, as the back tires screamed
Now for them my man [Incomprehensible], ruined his whole dream

Of playin' ball pro, bitch that's how it go
You let me know, I'll hit your whole fuckin' team with the metal
Mental struggle got my hand under the bubble
Tryin' to blow steam and leave the scene blood puddles

Snakes, whattup nigga? These niggaz ain't explainin'
Well, fuck it then, it's time for some gestratin'
Hit him in the worthless shell he came in
Murder is a sin, but it's worse him dyin' on revenge and I ain't havin' it

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

I ain't havin' it, reached in the bubble and grabbed it
Automatic cocked back and squeezed through his Polo fabric
Nigga duckin' and runnin', irrationally gunnin'
Thinkin' to myself, do I gotta hit someone

Then I heard shots from a back route
Fired back out, got shot, dropped and blacked out
Put in a clap out, didn't map out or act out the plans
Now I'm consciously layin' while bullets is sprayin' the Caravan

We can't lose, I hear shotguns then 22's
Left arm booze, or blood soaked through my Adidas shoes
Heavy breathin', a lot of bleedin'
Bitches screamin', put over on my good shoulder, started squeezin'

Out the back window, she gave the wrong info
Suddenly crashed into a Pinto
Hopped out, flew through the back yard, word to God
It's on and I felt the gat slip through my palm

Kept runnin', hopped the fence, hopin' that I didn't leave prints
Spotted a black Ac' parked with dark tints
Broke the passenger's side, hotwired the wide and slide
Another unsolved homicide

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that
Get caught up in these streets
Get shot up by them heats

y'all don't want beef
No y'all don't want that

"It's Talib Kweli in the place to be Brooklyn
Most definitely yaknowhatImsayin', Mount Vernon
And Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth, the brothers who brought ya
Escapism, Return Of The Mecca, Straighten It Out, The Creators
Yeah, right about now, we about to make history

The track make you nod like smack through the needle
Niggaz don't sell crack is they evil
America's build on the backs of my people
Cats say they packin' the heat but they actin' like Chino
'Cause when it's time to bounce it back they fall back in the field though

I went from crashin' the beat in the passenger seat
Drivin' like many straight trees don't even mix coke with the Henney
Flow with so many styles ladies open all night like Denis
24 hours party people soakin' in the Remy and Cris'

The video is directed by Benny and Chris
Treat a pager like a website with plenty of hits
I tell 'em this, you gotta be at least a dime for a piece of mind
I deal with porters and keys just like the leachious mind

I like mature girls just now reachin' they prime
Know how to conversate to the man and don't eat no swine
If you ready to roll than we can rock shit
My niggaz so cold we hot

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

Psychedelic we sell it and niggaz jealous fellows
Go get your hate up get your weight up, I'm tellin' you straight up
You need to turn that frown upside down you use less muscles
The smile is easier than it sound, it's true

Lookin' all crooked, I be tellin' these dudes
They should Straighten It Out on a Pete Rock track like C.L. Smooth
See we livin' in the Matrix way before the movie
Kids fiend before the camera screaming, just shoot me

Now they scream a million miles away from the sun
But you still feel the heat when we packed us the way of the gun
Like tape digs, raise kids to escape the slave ships
Instead they wanna pump weights not the state

Better exercise take from work the rest get left inside
And whips chicks and kicks money we specialize
I be the respirator so hip hop is kept alive
So many niggaz buggin' me, I need a fuckin' pesticide

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

You put light back to life 'cause these rappers ain't actin' right
Thinkin' they cut like Mack the knife, rap the fight
Battle right through the afterlife
'Cause when you die make you look way past the life

And high sight, I drop the type of rhyme to give the blind sight
Sparkle a shine bright like lemon lime, sprite up in the limelight
Yeah as we still at the track, you feel it when the chorus tack
You deal it twist a cap back with a skillet, official would kill it

'This is fake the way we sill it as the great Pete Rock and Kweli
Got Pete to make you chicks knees knock to Pete Rock my life
It's the soundtrack other niggaz sound wack
Like white kids tryin' to sound black

I spit on mics wet up the essence where L drowned at
This Guerrilla Monsoon Rap first comb rap
Soon rap come through a crossroads and all these lost souls
Will stand out with stress signals like morse code

Pete Rock, murderville keep the joint on smash
See the don come through enough bray that cash
Talib Kweli, he can speak to the mass
Why the great minds think alike 'cause we keepin' it fly

See we keepin' it fly till the day I die and you can't deny
Son we keepin' it fly, how we keepin' this fly
Better master your eye, 'cause we keepin' it fly
Bring it back to life

I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

Yo, master of ceremony, controlled territory
It's Tay, the mad journalist always trying to write a better story
And laying tracks 'cause it's better for me
Calm but predatory, sun niggaz even when the weathers stormy

My crew is down to do whatever for me
Got my back like scoliosis when I'm handling mine
Find it hard, though to manage my time
Between the gaming and rhymes, without severing my family ties

But yo, that's what happens when the world is loving you
Groupies skipping pills with ill plans of fucking you
A high price for fame that's non-refundable
All in the hopes of one day coming out with a double you

I know it sound crazy, right?
Even though it's hard sometimes I still got to stay in the mix
It's Pete Rock on the snare drums and laying the kicks
And on the real I wouldn't trade it for shit
Let's get it up right now, come on

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

P.R. and L.B. got that shit for blocks
Hip hop when we walk, hip hop when we talk
You can hear it our slang and see the New York

We bought back 94 when the music was pure
Everybody made jams 93' and before
Hearing 'Illmatic' first on the trip to the store
Lost my mind but I knew it was
That we had to work toward forward

On we move now, my life is the roof
Putting the pen to the pad when it's time to spread news
Daily digesting some more wack shit
Mother-fuckers better stick to the script
We need you back Jay

y'all dudes know now we not for play
You want it funky, come around my way

You can choose to rock or choose to roll
I chose Pete 'cause he got the soul
Yeah, let's get it going y'all

I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby
I wanna rock with you
So get on the floor with me
I wanna give it to ya, baby

King cobra rapper crew
Ill Capitan, never roll a foot solider
We push over, you pushovers
Lil' pussies need to douche over

Mass and Gills, Scott hare will make em' gush over
Pussy and poetry, two things that's good for ya
We rock hard just like the hood told us
That fake shit I never could show you
We ought to keep it true and authentic

In they videos trying to walk wit it
L.B. put the street talk in it
From right now till the day that we forfeit it
Just making sure that y'all get it in time to put my heart in it

I can see me leavin' Suze and bring it home to mama
What you lookin at is pure bred stallion
I'm slayin' it you really care to know whose jay in it
Oh how lucky are we catch you comin' out the shower

Shut down the joint, me I'm just laidback and all
Surrounded by the gangsters puffin' on the cigar
Badder chick in the world keep niggaz cranked
Yes the hottest chick on the planet keep a nigga ranked
The question is can you top that homie
You can probably pull something close but stop that homie
Not even, could have that even if I stopped breathin'
Don't hope for that my ghost will be pokin' the steel

Once I settled in you made me a gentleman

How the don keeps the fun to blow in the wind
World war is magnetic that attracts loot
She look Wall Street briefcase, pen strife suit
The hair rub in a bun, spectacles on her nose
Any deal she makes, my business grows
They say a woman's never satisfied
Till she have me to fill it to her heart's content
It's my blessing, God gave you to me
And words can't describe, what you do for me
Your C.L. is, love me or love me not

Are you really ready for some super dynamite SOUL
Relax, let me spark the L
And leave smoke on the track as the tires peel
When I rock what's real niggaz appeal to that
13 in the game, makin classic rap
And stay elusive, a lot of y'all fake-ass niggaz
Wish you can do this, passion from the heart makes you true in this
Music, number one sound, overground
Make haste on the freeway like the Greyhound
And avoid these clowns and let real niggaz know
Pete Rock blast off in 2004, uhh

[Chorus] - repeat 2X

"Get your drank on, get your smoke on
Get your dance on, skin tight pants on
Get your party on, get your holla on
Doogie-dance, lil' mama, get your party on

Get your groove on, get your yak on
If you game tight, playa, get your mack on
Get your thug on, get your buzz on
But don't forget we livin' in a warzone

Bouncers actin' like cops in the club
Mother fuck around and get dropped in the club
They don't play enough 2Pac in the club
The industry done made too pop in the club

That nigga don't need no mink in the club
15 Dollas for a drink in the club?
Got it like a fuckin precinct in the club
What do these motherfuckers think in the club, come on

Whole lotta ass in the club
Ballaz spend a lotta cash in the club
Whole lotta dro gettin' passed in the club
But them cameras got the zone blasted in the club

I don't even bring ID to the club
Why they need to know my government name in the club?
I ain't got no paper for a bar in the club
I already got drunk fore I came in the club, come on

Get your drank on, get your smoke on
Get your dance on, skin tight pants on
Get your party on, get your holla on
Doogie-dance, lil' mama, get your party on

Get your groove on, get your yak on
If you game tight, playa, get your mack on
Get your thug on, get your buzz on
But don't forget we livin' in a warzone

Everybody act like thugs in the club they get drug in the club
Blowed like Shyne in the club lost they mind in the club
Puffin off like thugs in the club
Spendin' up yo whole paycheck in the club
Don't get no respect in the club niggaz sell dro in the club
But we can't blow in the club that's why I don't go in the club

Get your drank on, get your smoke on
Get your dance on, skin tight pants on
Get your party on, get your holla on
Doogie-dance, lil' mama, get your party on

Get your groove on, get your yak on

I don't even bring ID to the club
Why they need to know my government name in the club?
I ain't got no paper for a bar in the club
I already got drunk fore I came in the club, come on

Forget about the world outside in the club
You can run but you can't hide in the club
Dance to the government lies in the club
Fuck that, party all night in the club

Still dames got no rights in the club
Party by the disco lights in the club
We spend a lotta cash in the club
But we don't got it on smash in the club 'cause
(Come on)

Get your drank on, get your smoke on
Get your dance on, skin tight pants on

Doogie-dance, lil' mama, get your party on

Get your groove on, get your yak on
If you game tight, playa, get your mack on
Get your thug on, get your buzz on
But don't forget we livin' in a warzone

Everybody's girlfriend's eating in the club
Everybody's boyfriend's eating in the club
Niggaz got a shank in a boot in the club [unverified]
Ready to cut a secret ID from the hands in the club [unverified]

Like what is corrupt in the club niggaz buy weed in the club
Crackers buy coke in the club
Get high in the club then die in the club
But they gotta bring identify in the club

If you see me in the club give a pound and a hug
Show love I'm just another thug in the club
But you can't rub me the wrong way
We can get it one, sho nuff, in the club

We can take it out in the club what's it all about, nigga what?
Why the fuck I came in the club get fucked up in the club
Loose a lot of blood in the club why the fuck I came in the club?

Get your drank on, get your smoke on
Get your dance on, skin tight pants on
Get your party on, get your holla on
Doogie-dance, lil' mama, get your party on

Get your groove on, get your yak on
If you game tight, playa, get your mack on
Get your thug on, get your buzz on

"[Kardinal]
Yeah, I see you P'Rrahh
It's Mr. Kardinal, we good
Worry about us, it's Kardinal Offishall
Knahmean, circle niggaz in dis
Why'knahmean, straight from T Dot
Linked up with the grand master of the beats, P'Rrrah
It's the Pete Rock, why-yeah, NY to T Dot
C'mon - yeah, raisin my fist
Is like the bat sign, bringin out lyricists
I attract heat, I be the under overground
Microphone magician, subteranean, unindentified
Sky-toucher, maneuver the machines
And rip apart MC's and hang 'em from the seams (yeah)
Large nigga seem scary, out in the hood
Shootin tic-tac-toe in your Burberry
For generations, a cold verse killer's been chillin out
Waitin in the cut, spillin out
Hot shit, yeah they feelin me now, cause I linked with Pete
The best at it since Nas and ""Illmatic""
Respect is automatic, got it, well hold it
A lot of MC's will need it to pay they rent, sewed it
And eventually fold it (uh-huh) check my resume
I'm like H&R Block when I rock
Y'all niggaz get the greatest return, plus a 3rd degree burn
When I earn airtime like H. Stern
Kardinal's like a 20 carat diamond
Up in the rough dust, New York check the shinin
I'm intertwinin, line for line combinin
With Mr. Rock rhymin, flowin on time and
Stop your whinin, y'all couldn't let go
Since I flowed over the remix of ""Grindin'""

[Chorus: Kardinal]
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in the USA, they say ""yes DJ""
When Pete's in the blend they say ""my nigga come again""
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in J.A. they say ""yes DJ""
When I'm in the see-A-N they say ""my nigga come again""

[Kardinal]
Yeah what makes the best rapper, ice on the wrist?
Ice on the chain? Ice in the bucket with the Crist'?
Ice grill, iced down, ice inside my frown
Ice start sparklin on the spaghetti strap gown (HU!)
Kardinal, nickname No Gimmicks
Still the nigga to get up in it, rip the place down
Rock a wife beater, show off my belly when I'm ready
The type to drive around on bootleg Pirellis
MC's gettin stuck like clubgoers in Chi-Town
Rip any prick from Brixton to my town
The T Dot, yeah you know me
Bringin back the bad bwoy style, yeah ya owe me
Gun finger in da air, shootin blanks
Thinkin bout the day I can live next to Phil Banks
'Til then, my circle niggaz straight out the hood
Don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good

[Chorus]
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in J.A. they say ""yes DJ""
When I'm in Brixton they say ""my nigga come again""

[Kardinal]
Yo yo, protect your +Head & Shoulders+ when the Kardinal bust
Boy I take care of two in one shot like +Pert Plus+
Buck buck! Niggaz get dumb live on acetate
Massacre masses of MC's on mixtapes (yup)
Street cats get taken out with street raps
Live from the streets where peeps meet to see a weak nigga see defeat
Why'know, take a week to look back
And reflect on how you can't spit when Kardinal speak
Unique like o-ccasional crackheads
Monster talk to settin off a gourmet verse like rice pilaf
(Fuck off!) I'm great
Save the petty black trash talkin for Ricky Lake

[Chorus]
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good
Kardinal and Pete Rock crank up in the hood
When I'm in the USA, they say ""yes DJ""
When I'm in the see-A-N they say ""my nigga come again""
We good (we good) don't worry 'bout us, nigga we good

When I'm in J.A. they say ""yes DJ""
When Pete's in the blend they say ""my nigga come again""

"Uh! Man I never did no shit like this before man
I just keep hearin' this fuckin' voice in my head man
It's like it's good vs. evil really man
On one side I hear somethin', 
And on the other side I hear some other shit

It feel like fire (fire) Shut up in your bones
What's this devilish shit you on?
(It's like the body of a vampire, you nocturnal, you don't tire)
Only move around in the dark
The light burns your skin you have no heart
(They call me Mr. Sinister, arch angel, Lucifer)
I'm a son to the anarchy
I'll show you the way if you follow me
(And I come in many shapes, the message I spread to you, is hate!)
And I'm a catch you a homicide
They killed your cousin in your face and you 'gon' let it slide?!
(But I got plans for ya, do this for me I'll show ya how my child adore ya)

I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

Now do it just how we planned
(Get right up on him and blam!)
You can do it from the front or behind
(But I wanna see a nigga lose his mind)
And don't worry 'bout the police
(That's just one less nigga on the streets)
And now this block is yours
(His girl is yours!) The world is yours!
(I'm just a voice in ya head)
A figment of your imagination instead
(And I spoke to the best of them, got a long list
And I ain't get to the rest of them)
(And not yet, how much you wanna bet,
I make you go postal shootout your projects)
(Or you whole school, you a young fool, 
And don't nobody love you like I do)

I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!)
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!

My child! I have a place you could rest
And take the stress off your chest
Just sell me your soul and we go
To the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
I make you rich (Celebrity overnight)
Fuck bitches (Sell drugs) Live your life
(Don't need to worry 'bout nothin'!)
Keep on gunnin', keep on hustlin'
(Plus I know how to make it pop)
Oh you a hot boy? I know you like it hot
(So give a nigga up, go 'head, wear a wire set a nigga up)
(And all your care about is Benji's)
Triflin' you don't feed the hood, you stingy!
(And it's just a dream and it don't seem right)
(You ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light?)

I feel like I'm torn (fire!) 
What's right or wrong? (fire!)
All my thoughts are lethal (fire!) 
I see dead people (fire!) Lord help me!
I feel like I'm torn (fire!)

Back to, Pete Rock and Smif-n-wessun lyrics
These lyrics are not available for printing.",6
"It's time to dip dive dip, you might break a hip
To the sound that's legit, I've come to make a hit
I usually bust scratches with my brother, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide you're going on a ride
I know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
Guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire
Beats are rough and rugged, Pete Rock is the creator
Now I'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada
Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up, I save this subject for later
But, it's time to catch wreck with the creator

I'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there's a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold cause I'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
Fortified with soul cause that's what I give 'em
Honeys form a line form a line cause I always seem to capure
Beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
Far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this, don't even consider it
Skins when I want 'em, but, only when I need 'em
To set the record straight, I'll be damned if eat 'em
Call me Pete Rock, I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow, because you know I'm good to go
As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this

Now, I'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec to get some wreck
Never filled with anger, a good body banger
If you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can't see this
My word is beneficial, Pete Rock is the issue
And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch (Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse (No question)
Either one, I can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around, I'll show you what I mean
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

It's time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator

C.L. Smooth, get busy",6
"Some live the good life loungin' by the pool 
Catching a suntan and everything's cool 
Male or female  you want to be set 
In the big mansion drinking Moet 

You read the Wall Street Journal 
Later for the comic 
Far from dumb because you practice logic 
You lived poor in the ghetto 

Never had the money easily 
But you found the remedy 
So you  your girl  and your kids could have a better opportunity 
And teach them all about unity 

Cultivating in the brains the words of Allah the master 
And they go far 
But, you still go visit your old stomping ground 
Indeed to help another that's down 

A tough situation cuts like a knife 
In search of the good life 

From the church, the home, on down to the prison 
People want to know how is he and she living 
Does he work? 
Do you wonder if his life will bloom? 

Is the girl going to have the kid anytime soon? 
How's the mother? 
Do they ever go visit the brother? 
What about the dad? 

I heard he drinks undercover 
Some are still shooting up, another on crack 
Just the other day trooper got sent back 
What type of life do you lead? 

Tell me 
'Cause you can be anything you want to be 
Some will strive for the good life in any case 
The mind is a terrible thing to waste 

On drugs, violence, and hatred of another color 
Hear me now, brother 
All around the world the husband and wife 
Work night and day in search of the good life 

The G double O-D L-I-F-E 
Living in luxury 
Care free 
Period 

No time to waste 
We catch ours all day 
We work instead of play 
I B-U-I-L-D inside me 

Knowledge and quickly you vacate the city 
From a paranoid mental delusion 
Plain and simple 
I won't cause confusion 

Yo, that's your fault 
Stop the somersault 
'Cause I put the bad like mo to a halt 
My destiny I define is heavenly 

So, Fort Knox, open sesame 
Light shines and the birds keep singing 
As I still cling to my positive upbringing 
With the need to succeed, right? 

On a natural high 
The good life",5
"[Pete Rock]
Uhh
Ahh yeah
What we talkin bout? Talkin bout the skinz
Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

[CL Smooth]
I hear it callin never stallin hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it`s loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca want to bang bang
Beggin a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thang
CL, kickin flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin on the wins, I`m about to hit the skinz

[Pete Rock]
Talkin bout the skinz
The skinz
That`s right, talkin bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin bout an everyday thing
C`mon

[Grand Puba]
Ha ha ha!
Hey, hey
Yeah...

Nowadays I`m on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)`ll kick you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziplock
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it`s hard like Charles Bronson
It`s kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world over big botty girls
Won`t hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
cause when I jump into my thing I make the bedspring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who`s the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she`ll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won`t be the Post
After that you know the flavor I`m ghost!

[Pete Rock]
That`s right, be out..
Hit it off.. on the skinz

[Cl Smooth]
C`mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they`re forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
but never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won`t curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
sleepin with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I`m with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

[Pete Rock]
Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damnit) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin like thunder
til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I`m out

[CL Smooth]
Like the Isley`s, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it`s OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

[Pete Rock]
How I hit the skinz, uhh
It`s fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don`t try to show
Because I`m, the accurate man
Everybody knows it
Peace to all stealers
of the Mount Vernon
Young poets and players
New Rochelle, the Bronx...",6
"Here comes the hurricane, C.L. same name
Cut by the grain when I land upon the plain
Jah knew the Hebrew, a Papa Duke need you
But none of the fam who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime rate, words coagulate
Generate the mind's state, never can deflate
Nigger, you jigaboo, it doesn't have to be you
Funny like a cartoon, Pepe Le Pew
Pimp are the lyrical, g-string the individual
But the metaphysical isn't spriritual
Straight from the heart I frame the art
Tune up my class, real fast, very smart
Dictate the technique, wait a minute, I speak
Loved by my son and a kiss on the cheek
Stutter-step the concept, blueprint, or pro
Steady as we go so act like you know

I stand by the rabbi, sail in Shanghai
Always had an alibi even if I lie
Crucial, never neutral, bare the fruitful
Past time, another rhyme, skedaddle, Yankee Doodle
Light skin in lovely gyp, just for the honey dip
Here to make a megahit fit
Don't install the pipe dream, renaissance regime
When you run ragged I pick up the steam
Chart on the record book, what Corey Love took the hook
Here's a new book to civilize a crook
Purest of the pedigree, feed 'em a line
C.L., no Jezebel, can never sleep well
Thick like a dred, at the Club Med
The Mecca Don said, a fish out of water is dead
Pete Rock, the soul brother, cruise on a flow
Swing low and yell ""Geronimo!"", act like you know

C.L. can play like Nike, come on just do it
Pacify the Gemini, soul into it
Beat to my feet is a lock like concrete
Hard for the street, decipher never incomplete
A clean editorial, rather historical
Affordable, recordable, nifty like a portable
Mecca is the syndrome, when I come back home
Boogie on a baritone, listen on a phone
Libra, the achiever, toke a reefer
C.L. the girl pleaser, like Ebanezer
So here is the good sign, I incline
Titties with the bitties when I wine and dine
Worn like corduroy, comes the bad boy
But just like Anita Pita, I bring ya joy
""Agoobilonians"" with your knowledge
And take as said so, flow and act like you know",6
"""You know, nowadays it, seems like there's a lot of..
Bad things going on and, I guess a lot of it,

Fellow brothers and sisters""

(Let's get together, and raise)

South Africa, what does it mean?
To burst the scene, or conquer like a philistene
War or peace, which one do you prefer?
Pass me my M-16 for the disaster
A reason for the treason in a jet black season
For peace, justice, and freedom
For the Original Man, architect of the Motherland
Kings to Queens, is the Asiatic Black plan
Pre-Adam-ite, first to see the light
Way before Adam and Eve took flight
Bless the seed of Abraham, I came to jam
Protest the teachings of another man
Uncle Tom stay loyal so they boil
I'm the alchemist with the twist from the true soil
My blood brother Adolpho on the side of me
My vision ain't blurry, so don't even lie to me
The rebirth the revival of our culture survival
To elevate, the black man is vital
You gotta realize now what we're facing
The floors I'm pacing from the anger in the nation

(Let's get together!)

Here's the situation from a darker view
Night and day, salt and pepper in the earthly stew
But the salt think it taste better, straight up superior
Therefore, the flavor of the pepper's inferior
Incorrect though, giving some heartburn
Level of a devil better wait your turn
And here is one recollection of imperfection
No one should be judged by complexion
Lie-braries; broken down as lies buried
To force their beliefs to pilgrims all hurried
Television; tell-a-lie-vision
A schism; negative realism
Four-hundred-and-thirty-five years til weak
Mental deaf dumb and blindness put us to sleep
Out of the dark comes light so the first can't be
So Armaggedeon comes like a thief in the night
Rednecks flex to my context but in the projects
Some won't survive the next confrontation
And I'm aware of segregation
Pump your black fist for the anger in the nation

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

Some walk slow, cause the water's not shallow
Let my people go, you little Pharoah
Listen how they word it, be observant
Then house negro; today, civil servant
I want to drop the bomb but remain calm
Strong like the power of the Fruits of Islam
Black is beautiful, hot like fire
Guess how many times they thought they killed the Messiah
Malcolm X, Dr. King, let's sing
All around the world let freedom ring
Reality is real, so how do you feel
From being kings on a throne to picking cotton in a field?
Your slavery is lack of identity
One of the things that's not making you a friend of me
What's your cause - aim, rationale?
Cause I made up my mind, I never scrape or bow
But teach my own, the sound of black unity
Together we can rise and now's the opportunity
The Tuskegee Experiment, indeed it was big
When they used the black man as a guinea pig
Animalism, pumped on a lower level
But can only be the works of the devil
And I'm telling you now the frustration
The future's facing from the anger in the nation

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together, and raise)

(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)
(Let's get together!)

"Here come's the rugged one, plus the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark lover, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
Cuz I can do wonders under cover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause slick like blue nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow blood clot

Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah
So funky, like a street junky
Like I said before, here we go, c'mon
For Pete's sake I break and update, wait, I radiate
The dub played to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission
The P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K., resume
With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Off spring the lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round
The cut don't flow that I touch is not a preemie
And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie
I don't think so, peace, I gotta go
And shake like an earthquake, cousin, for Pete's sake

To my man

Here come's the rugged one, plus the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark brother, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
Cause I can do wonders under cover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause I'm slick like lunile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow blood clot
Yo, my style's cock-diesel and I can do the hustle
Niggas know the time, I don't have to flex a muscle
I'm not the type to fake it, I wouldn't try to take it
Tie your girl to the back of my Jeep butt-naked
Slide her monkey ass down the hill
So if you don't want beef, money, chill for Pete's sake

To my man

Music please

The Mecca's sweet like nectar, maybe cause you need it
There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I suplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black press can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a pena
Perfect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renagade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla
C.L. Smooth and Pete Rock
Could break and penetrate, piece of cake, cousin, for Pete's sake

To my man, for Pete's Sake, c'mon",6
"Above the level of a mezzanine, healthy as Ovaltine
The dominant gene clean, I mean go, the light's green
The protege could play like chess to quest the best
Confess, never poor as Bangladesh
I get busy like a boxer, operate like a Doctor
Seal like a locker, pop like Orville Redenbacher
Buy the tape, LP, CD
All me, and Petey, to cater to the needy
Like a Prayer for Madonna but A Different World for Jasmine
CL is well a physical attraction
Let me make myself perfectly clear:
While I'm there, I make a peer a positive pap smear
Really I do, once I light the barbeque
Thread the loose ends, see my friends are the crew
The fright night King of New York like Frank White
If it ain't rough it ain't right man listen

If it ain't rough enough, to mingle in the stuff
To scar and scuff and make you cuckoo like a cocoa puff;
It ain't right so I smash the satellite
Check the farenheight, before I take flight
Unique as Mozambique, here to freak Sheik
The skills that won't leak, and never antique
Warm like a oven you're lovin the style I'm druggin
Alleyway muggin, heavyweight sluggin
No fibs I kick the ad libs and rock it in the cribs
Break your ribs like a toothpick cause you were never slick
? you lacked back when I first started
CL's the one who got the Red Sea parted
My conversation qualification is a doozy
The rude Rudy wreckin write you off as a floozy
I shoot for the moon, but even if I miss
I'm among the stars, to put a bullethole in Mars

In my frame of mind I design the best-seller
For rougher cats can Rockafeller you're Penn and Teller
Steady with the convo, rought like Brillo
Let your head hit the bed and knock the feathers out your pillow
The master intelligent, with the black testament
Found it relevant, and mailed it to the President
But overall I get papes for my labor
With the physical manifestation of a saviour
You wanna test this, but I slay anyway
Cause your rhymes are old, with more wrinkles than a shar pei
Mecca Don upon the streets of Babylon
Pass the baton to respond like Farrakhan
Hard like Shaft with the staff for the Backdraft
A blazin aftermath, so hon make a path
If you don't trust him, bust him
But if you don't have a weapon, then kid keep steppin
The main idea in here for the hemisphere
CL's here to get wreck for the year
A large man's appetite, blowin like dynamite
If it ain't rough it ain't right, COME ON!",6
"Prepare yourself to catch a verse from the big purse 
Rotate the megahertz  where you heard it first 
The perpendicular  said none similar 
Quadruple any figure  quick on the trigger 

Helter skelter  wig out by the goodfella 
Not Lou Pinella 'cause I'm black and mo' betta 
Bust a phenomenum  we come to get busy 
Deep in roots  but my name ain't Kizzie 

Many many march 'cause I'm heavy on the starch 
Never tell a farce when I scale on a arch 
Jammin' on the radio, brothers say, ""way to go"" 
Shape it like Play-Do, soprano at the Chateau 

My theory periodically flows a odyssey 
Bigger than modern technology 
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat 
It's like that... 

C.L. is the attribute you salute 
'Cause I gotta make loot, can't afford to be cute 
Enter the equilibrium in a medium 
Breaking your cranium with no ultimatum 

Drop a psalm like a bomb, never land in your palm 
And now I'm so cool and calm 
Pure unadulterated, premeditated 
Lyrical form, Pete Rock is the storm 

Sophistication I kick to a nation 
I rare compilation I call recreation 
The prognosis, so mackadocious 
Straight up ferocious for those who can focus 

Large like the Beatles, ask all my peoples 
Never make movies, so don't talk sequels 
So, hon, save the chit-chat when I kick a format fat (it's fat) 
It's like that... 

I'm all sold out, no doubt, without a question 
The blessing your guests in a suprucated session 
Anyway your honor, heresay the melee 
Is here for the payday, so A to the K 

Or should I say Deda, original baby par 
Smooth like a reservoir, the funky Shang-Ri-La 
No shame in my game, I'm set to entertain 
And if it wasn't for the fame, skinz would never know my name 

So back off a tad bit, that's a bad habit 
'Cause I write the raw...for sure 
Now I'm a flip a style and get crazy versatile 
Never fragile 'cause I'm flowin' like the Nile 

Swing a jewel or a gem, notice how I say them 
With my approach, smoke a rhyme to a roach 
A four-season lover, light-skinned and bigger 
But what I deliver come before the cotton picker 

So here's to another hit, perfectly legitimate 
When I hit the skinz, guaranteed to keep the candle lit 
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat 
It's like that...",6
"Lots of lovin' lots of lovin' 

A sweet serenade  sip lemonade 
As we laid inside the shade 
My heart was captured when you possessed it 
Caressed and blessed it  even suggested 
You love me and I love 
And together it would just be us two 
I would protect ya  in your moment of fear 
Relax lover come here 
And let's create this heavenly fantasy 
When you lay next to me 
I need you, and only you, to give me more 
Tender love right down to the core 
If you could read what's on my mind 
You will find my feelings are genuine 
Day after day, you're the one I'm thinking of 
With lots of love 

Lots of lovin', lots of lovin', the heat 

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice 
Make love everyday, okay, produce 
I ride through the tunnel of love, share a milkshake 
Carve our name in a tree by the lake 
Look in your eyes 'cause I miss you much 
The way you say, ""I love you, C.L."" and your gentle touch 
We reminisce with a french kiss 
And out of all the girls, you're the first on my list 
The only one now, and truly for life 
My fiance and future wife 
Now you realize, you're the one I'm thinking of 
With lots of love 

Lots of lovin', lots of lovin', the heat 

You want to be treated like a queen, stroked like a kitten 
Every night you're the mitten I'm fittin' 
Tease your lips with the tip of my tongue 
And there's no doubt about it, lady, I'm strung 
On your love, looks, and affection 
You qualify, top choice selection 
Woman of a darker breed 
Mmm, cutie, you got what I need 
Pour the champagne and toast the glass 
Taste, but don't drink too fast 
'Cause we got many nights to cuddle by the fireplace 
You blush when I touch your face 
Now you realize you're the one I'm thinking of 
With lots of love 

Lots of lovin', lots of lovin', the heat 

Allah made you beautiful and youthful 
So I feel giving you love is suitable 
A walk by the beach, watch the sunset 
Love is strong, like when we first met 
Wake up in the morning, see your face 
And I feel no one can take your place 
Ever, so don't even think about it 
I need your love and I can't live without it 
Baby, you're the one I'm thinking of 
From C.L. Smooth, with lots of love 

Lots of lovin', lots of lovin', the heat",7
"""He's a SWEET soul brother""

Soul Brother #1, here I come on the new tip
Nestle coated right, cause I'm rich thick and chocolate
Plug up any mic I'll bet you Pete Rock'll spark it
Hons always ask what's the bulge in my pocket
I tell em, ""Papes,"" I rock them top to bottom
Never hesitate to say (""Mmm I got them"")
Oppressed on the Hillside, over on the chill-side
Of town, so let's get down
Funky is the word describe this Brother on a Soul mission
Hookin rugged joints, more Soul than the Soul Kitchen
CL doesn't scratch, so I won't leave you itchin
White people even say, ""Pete Rock is bitchin""
Harder than the hardest, odder than the oddest
I guess that's just because I'm smarter than the smartest
So back up, clear the path hon cause here I come
Soul Brother #1

I hit harder than a kick, quick to scoop a chick
When it comes to skinz, Pete Rock got it thick
I'm not your average, everyday, one-two to the beat
And don't stop, bust the shit I drop
New style for the 90's Pete Rock's a trendsetter
I'd just be lyin if I said there's someone better
You can ask Greta, Greta with the red Jetta
Honey did me lovely and I'm glad that I met her
I come style after style, sucker MC's try to swallow
But them seem to say my style's too hard to follow
So just raise your hand and give praise to the #1
Soul Brother, who keeps the crowd in a daze
Pete Rock, and CL Smooth and if it ain't our groove
Then you might not move
Remember, cause there's no need to worry none
Yo, Soul Brother #1

Soul Brother #1

Nuff respect to my man Grand Puba
Nuff respect to my man BizMarkie
Nuff respect to my man CL Smooth
Nuff respect to EPMD
I'm like high octane, with everything to gain
Those who try to step to this can catch pain
I keep a mag in the trunk of my Jag, in case some punk fag
Wants to catch one bad
Soul Brother #1, and I didn't come to riff
The finesse I posess will make the hardest unstiff
I'm full of motivation handle any situation
Hon said I'm so smooth they should call me lubrication
Mr. Splendor, a good back bender
Honies always say, Pete love me tender
Call on Pete Rock, CL Smooth if you want the job done
Soul Brother #1",6
"Uh, yeah. Uh-huh
We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon

Walk the fine, short line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Show-lin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one to five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

Tell 'em straighten it out
Ah, yeah straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?) straighten it out
That's right y'all straighten it out (say what?)
You got to straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out yeah
Straighten it out it's like that (say what?)

The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, where the Troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bass line's critical
Better than the original who first made it
But now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, seeya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

Yeah, true straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to straighten it out
(Say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
C'mon (say what?) straighten it out
That's right straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out you got to
Straighten it out c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must straighten it out
Say what?
Straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out
The YG's, they must straighten it out
The Hilltop, they muststraighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must straighten it out
Everybody must straighten it out
Come on straighten it out
Ah, yeah straighten it out (to close)",6
"All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been
All the places and spaces I've been

Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
Places I drive all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find some toys when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real so feel I'm sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the kings revalation
Had heard me on the run-dmc's reincarnation
Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide
Every where this black man resides still
Check the monolouge, I'm on a 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers, do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler
But any season or reason we can't take it over

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged ready war?
Known to be the smooth that sat by the door
Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats
Take all that dirty money, set the wash doors and laundromats
You love to gamble now we open an after-hours spot
20 Sacks with the guiness for the jackpot
Members only, playing pool like willie marconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the gs I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to yugenot street
Palled around the screen tv watching the fight
Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it?

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

Traveling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missle I probe and seek, many can't critique
My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been?
Still sliding girls in as soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and groupies, condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker feet
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game
Pete rock and c.l. smooth's a household name

All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?
All the places and spaces I've been can you feel it?

"Let me take you on a journey through Carmel City
Where CL's God, and the ladies gotta hit me off
Ballin on the set now baby what's the matter
When all this is Hot Sex served on a platter
Enter my flow so I can hit this show with somethin rugged
It's mainly how all the honies dug it
Like every single day and, bounce around the way and
Chicks are never waiting when the bodies start marinating
We expand in player's land to unknowns
To turn my stumbling blocks, into my stepping stones
The pound Donna Karan New York down found
Where there can be no type of slacking in your macking
The whole agenda is for me to decide; the major hustle
Is God, when brothers coincide, with the bonafide
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

C'mon ya'll

Top notch, butterscotch, lyrics hits the mode
To make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude
Your eyes stay glued, when this is popping word is bond
Wifey's gone, now I'm about to get my swerve on
Lay my clothes across the bed, cause I'm here to make a point
Plenty chips, got me balling in a hot joint
Respect the sextafied aura you could never take light
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight
My large releases got me mixing with the dimepieces
And down to rival one of Uncle L's little nieces
In my palace of pleasure, everything is done properly
And if you didn't know, you better ask somebody
Right now, the players are the power structure
Check the roly-poly, now it's time you see the brother
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City

It's freaktacular, wasn't hard to get em out the blouse
If only wifey knew, hubby got a stash house
And what moves your man got with so much emphasis
Maybe one or two many get ridiculous
So scandalous, the honey arrives with her crew
And now they're talking bout coming back without you
Yeah my boys are balling, here's the raw deal:
Come to my house, you gotta get naked for real
Indulging, my peoples said let's have a talk
About the time my lady's plane hit New York
I'm bailing off the set, heading for the crib G
Cause I'm the first thing the woman wanna see
Take a hot shower, slip on some linen
Now it's a new time, a new day, a new beginning
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
With lovers only for me, in Carmel City",6
"We go back and forth, sending this out to my people up north
Tell 'em if you ain't from New York you're soft
Box or throw rocks, fish or cut bait
Cause I fight great, but wait
Here's the hottest joint on lockdown
Ready for release what they call a masterpiece
Covers are blown, known for keeping shit lethal
Cause now I'm like water in the desert for you thirsty people
What's the fixation with all this artillery?
Now you catch a look, saying ""Who are you to question me?""
Giving sighs from enemy lines taking care of my business
Is how you found out Wayne's World was never his
See my pend holds strong for all my cookies in mink
We call all types of bitches running out of ink
Later for ticky mind, avoid like suama
But I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

You know it's my thing, get your bell rang
By the Meccafied slang, the jack of all trades
Couldn't even gang bang, and niggas can't hang
With so many styles, you'd swear the shit was out of Wu-Tang
But the samurai, CL Smooth I
Be slicing, dicing you down when the mic is around
I rebound like Oakley when you provoke me
This is the Chocolate Thai, be careful how you toke me
I razzle dazzle your fragile ass until you pay homage
To the man I plan is holding all the knowledge
In five minutes of funk off my tounge, read the label shown
Is it Pete Rock or Oliver Stone?
Still the same, they remember my name
Kind of reminds me of when Rocket Ismail played for Notre Dame
Invincibility with no vulnerability
Selling more than gold with the killers on my payroll

You'd better watch your step, known for the rep
Of being real but can't accept jealous brothers and others
Who can't relax with pep, and if it was the playoffs
Your ass would get swept and kept on stash
The Tango & Cash competitors bow
Cause I would think we all know who The Don is by now
Making loot at the pace of a horse race
Now once again my friend, the great paperchase
Here's a taste of life in the fast lane
Now house full of chicks, he's stripping off the Don P
With the profound sound, I ride swoops like a hawk
And can only bring the essence of New York
It's the Vernonville daddy, can you comprehend?
How some real live niggas set a new trend
Of being so blasted, smoothest prophets to the brain cell
While I bid you all a farewell",6
"Check the verse in the Bible says man shall never covet
But in your life you put nothing above it, you seem to love it
Invest some stocks to clock what's in my stable
Sweating me like Cain sweating Abel, you're unstable
You couldn't speak, now what's the fake smile for?
The jealousy, that's why you're feeling so insecure
Used to be by my side but now all I see is pride
On the quest to make lucci, got you open wide
It feels funny, cause it never used to be that way
Remember PR back in the day?
Hey, the number's changed and the crib's a little fatter
But if you was real, you'd see it really wouldn't matter
Check the stat in fact yo, don't ever try to peep this
Don't mistake my kindness for a weakness
The name is Pete Rock, I'll take you higher than the izm
I'm on a exodus, Escapism

Yo, check it out
I like to rhyme, no time for silly head games
Strictly known for busting up your head frames
But skins bold, act like they want to know a nigga
Break they neck to show they figure
But yo, you can't gas me up, you can't hype me
Play it cool when it comes to schooling wifey
On the ways of life it's life, checks, and big money
So the next kid will be up on your honey
Sexing your honey, flexing your Benz and your money
Playing you like a crash test dummy, so take it from me
Cause when it happens don't say I never told you so
Peep the verbal lessons in the flow
And ayo, you know they style, and yeah I'm here to warn ya
Getting shaky cause I'm coming up on ya
It's Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth on a major pape mission
Rising to the top, Escapism

I'm sitting back, I got the funk on cruise
While you snooze Pete Rock is steady paying his dues
Putting styles on lock and making beats by the bundle
Scooping more props than Bryant Gumbel, and staying humble
But then you go and have to act that way
I just hit you off the other day!
But this is sick, cause here you come with your crew of derelicts
Talking about you need a pair of kicks, or this or that
You hang around cause the pockets are fat
But when I'm on ""E"" yo, you ain't trying to check for me
You got more game than rugby
You're only stressing the name now that the papes is flowing lovely
So stop searching for idealism
And check the off-beat flow of the Soul Brother with the realism
Shedding some light just like a prism
You can't wait, you can't fake it, Escapism",5
"Capture this funakthon loaded by the Mecca Don
Into the red zone, you spot my skull and crossbone alone
To fill the Watergates, slaughter great, think and meditate
Set behind the pace of the CL's war face
Cras and tints, making blueprints for over six figure salaries
Luchified, cause many did and died
The mic wrecka, study Mecca, now building
Cause I love my shorties like Jesus loved children
Cause being smooth is the science I crafted
To a state, when they incarsarate me I wanna be free
And play some D on the high-scoring thrill from the Veronville
Taking my yards with no bodyguards
My click's the first round draft pick for time in prison
So the only way to cover that is clean living
Respect given, hear the bell go ""ding""
It's like Tyson stepping back into the ring, soon as I

Ladies and gentlemen for dead presidents it represents
Now hear what it's like when I (get on the mic)
It's strike cause every Nike I wear is kicking ass there
Too dope to scare and too damn smooth to care
So flick your lighters in the air, and let me blow the roof off
The Collesseum plus I got to get per diem
All dueces file out, and leave the dimes to the front row
And when I say ""Go"" I want 'em showing lovin'
Tossing dough, cause with the daddy unemployed
And the old earth raising me, any other rugged nigga's history
No mystery, I'm physical in action
So guess relaxing is a weekend with Toni Braxton
On your TV is me, incredible MC, B
With the P to the R, my break a ways can bounce for days
This fillets, I'm trucking jewels like Eric B
And all you corny fools can't see me, oh my my my

Healthy, wealthy, and wise is your size
Come and try the hardcore, set on down by every law
Moving in your Lex trecks out a sextivity
At its highest level of funktagious served in major
He's the real Mabel, overqualified to be luchified
Pete Rock's the god when my stiz-ile profile
Slide into the Milky Way, the Carmel King's sing
We're back on crazy to put the duke up in Daisy
Amazingly, none of y'all can faze me never
Add the spice to make you shoop like Salt N Pepa
How large is he? Mastered my degree in mic surgery
With plans to retire at the tender age of 30
Jah is what I cherish, all informers must perish
On the down low, lift my peoples from the ghetto
In every borough CL is quite thorough
In do or die don't try when I anni",6
"What's goin on baby?
Ain't nothin' it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live
Let's get right to it

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

Feel the vibe when it's bumpin' in my tribe steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin' my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doin' trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, livin' well
And never cease to flip the hottest dime piece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slippin off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

You want a slow wind under my ceilin' fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rockin' you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasin' hits, takin' love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop fakin' me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dime pieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinkin totally nude with no limits
Goin' through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showin' nothin' but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doin them things, listen

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin' in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin' this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""
""I've got the love""
""I'm like tellin' you straight on up""

""I've got the love""
""Put the boogie back inform me and the crew and""

"Introducing funk from the yard, collecting strictly knockouts
The broters I sparred, which only means the man got nothing to prove
On a power move made by the CL Smooth
Live 495 I arrive in person
Hard dialogue without a whole bunch of cursing
It's my perrogitive, so back up and live, fool
As long as they don't violate everything's cool, cause it's all good
Understood is the smoothest daddy with the roughest raps
Am I thinking about blowing the spot? Perhaps
Carry straps on strips for the trigger-happy pirates
Where ladies catch fits steady reaching for my privates
But hold, how I unfold my whole repotoire
Now here we are at home to make another superstar
With Rob-O and Deda with the P.R
But nevertheless it's CL Smooth

""In the flesh""

Rob-O's at the top of the list, so bust this
Stick to funk like Scotch, the top-notch vocalist
You don't stop, cause I can illustrate with the needle
Penetrating straight to the souls of many people
Is there any evil? On this path I'm innovating
Stil faking, put down your pads and stop waiting
See the year of the fly MC is here, so stand clear
I'm facing the Gods with no fear
Rob-O, East Coast, uptown
MCing the most and spreading the Mecca all around
Selecting the sound to make the party people hound
The DJ for more of what I say in '94
It's like that, so don't stop
It's like this, so God bless
Soul Brothers get down with no stress
Yeah INI's representing in the flesh

""In the flesh""

Even in the mirror, it just doesn't get any clearer
I hear a funky beat and I gotta get nearer
KABOOM! Stepping in the sound room mellow
A dangerous flavorous fellow, hello
Style and grace, the original's in this piece
In the place right along with the pace
Nevertheless, in the flesh no quest
The sex in the system, of course I'm fresh
I rest in the Villes, the skills is big
To a level of extravagence, the talent's all balanced
The extreme dopeness for the nation
D. is the inital, MC's the occupation
Five master hype, light the color of the skin
Once the beat roll, my goal is to win
My friend the best, the real side yes
I rest my case in your face in the flesh

""In the flesh"" 

Soul Brother supreme to catch wreck in the flesh
So check one two and a mic test
Now clear the room, I scoped you with the wide angle zoom
Trying to overstand my funk tunes
Coming soon, so chill, don't stress The Creator
I'll kick the funk loop from here to Cal Tjader
And cross the fader, and pack the lines on my paper
With rhymes so tough, who got the flavor?
Plus the knack to rock, I'm steady heating up the spot
The Chocolate Boy Wonder making heads bop
In slow motion, domes crack open like the pavement
Off some shit I made down in the basement
The funk ambassador, asking you to get with the pro-
Fessional, yo there's no question I can flow
Time to slide, you know the P.R. will provide
The real and still I feel the vibe, I'm in the flesh

""In the flesh""",6
"I'd like to introduce myself

Check it out and give me my 'spect

Hit the lights and I appear beyond the stratosphere of Meccable function
And if you're pretty let your lady sleep in Carmel City
Begin and end the day on Lennon hunts for beachfronts
To lit blunts, now all agreed we're sippin OJ with the Dom P
Bounce and bring it like it counts to be Luccified
CL is sextified and women spell me nationwide
You say you want my lips where and I can grab your what?
I love your hips legs breasts faces with the firm butt
Now feel the muscle when I hustle in the bedsheets
Cause my manly treats can hit the fridge for more sweet
SPLASH, and let me do my thing til it's hot and sweaty
Reload the CamCorder, I guess by then you'll be ready
Cause All My Children got One Life to Live
But knockin wifey out the box is clearly a negative
I'm in rugged wears with fancy facial wears
And all the real shit come in pairs, and bounce em in the house y'all

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house

Back again, I'm here to win, to bust rhymes on beats again
Copycats and rugrats, sit back and watch a champion
It's time to wreck shop and show the world I'm true to hip-hop
So check the style and peace to niggas in the penile
Now umm, it's the original Funky Chicken tactic
I run game on your brain for the fame cause I'm active
You try to follow in my footsteps, you can't do it
I'm pullin your card it ain't hard, I don't have to prove it
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the utmost
From coast to coast, the music makes you overdose
You fiend, for the gangsta lean, I makes you scream
Rugged Bro Soul on the scene
A.k.a. the funk doer, numero uno, that means
Number one I get the job done plus I pack a gun
So run, and tell your peoples you'll be on the lookout
It's all about ""Who's in the House?"" with the funk

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house

Money up steps the new era of my lyrical terror
Funkadelic for lightin up spots ever since little tots
When the dust settle I'm packin heavy metal plenty
The drop'll slaughter many, strictly off illegal entry
It's elementary Watson, I drive a Benz not a Datsun
Before my kicks hit the stage, we've been Foot Locking
Body rockin to keep the ladies flockin with a concoction
Rippin your blouse for no less than arrest in Morehouse
My teeth prints where my knife slits, we train em
And scar em like pits, off vibes of the Mecca joint
Vibe to position, never runnin out of ammunition
Now to the heart, I'm steppin with a concealed weapon
Nothing's calm when the bomb blaze you know the phrase
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth knockin nowadays
Eastside kid, you don't want none, so catch a relay
I'm lettin off on anybody tryin to steal my DJ

Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house
Check it out, give me my 'spect
Pete Rock is in the house, CL is in the house",5
"On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

It's death before dishonor
Strap the vest down tight when you bring the drama
Now raise up off mine, and taste it in the raw
Before snipers on the floor galore, in my hardware store
Nightmares of thirsty crooks, niggas all acting fishy working off the books
Painting pictures of poverty, causing armed robbery
And if provoke every last one gets smoked
No doubt for real it's like wildlife
Where thugs forever pull caps and always keep a knife
Cause on the strip warefare's inevitable, hot steel's incredible
And it's a pride the revolution won't be televised
As I supply and demand, as I build my currency to expand, call it progress
When I bless my territory all respect due
But can niggas keep it real? it's on you

On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

Step into the dragon's lair, where cl's the don and pete's the creator
Now praise the most high and represent the best
Cause the number one killer of black men is stress
The armed and dangerous, the bulletproof
Couldn't stop the homicide of another youth
Penetrating your body parts with hollow point shells, you fraud
Cause vengence is mine said the lord, indeed
My own click now turns greedy
Out of twelve of my soldiers, one will decieve me
With salt in the game, shame the family and push
My black ass straight into a terrifying ambush
The whole empire's at stake
Mastering the streets, devil the mental won't break and turn snake
For pete's sake you gotta be true to the crew
So if niggas want to set it, it's on you

On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

Capture the beast within me, beware when it's moving deep in new york city
The diabolical gangster chronicle mob scenes in all directions
The type of connections to get your wig split
Submit the wanted signs posted, chickens spots for major knots you get
Toasted
To the head piece, I release firepower, only I'm controlling
We put in work and got the right brothers rolling
When hell kicks off we lick off
Keeping mine hard like stone from the red zone, to each his own
Smile in my face behind my back you talk trash
But my pockets hit empty and my lexus crashed
But not in your wildest dreams
Hear my name in all the scandals and all the schemes, I rest in queens
The veronville's my capital, so memorize the cuts
Then give you two more seconds to get off these nuts, it's on you

On you (""smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""when I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""just in case a brother acts a fool"")

Check it, grap luva, if you're in the house
Just get on the mic and show 'em what it's all about

It's all about the wicked check one two
Cause I rips a microphone and pass it to my crew
I don't drink no brew, I smoke nuff spliffs, I don't have no riffs
So check me as I shoot the gift
Rip rhymes, freestyle rhymes
Off top of the dome every time
I'm glad this shit is going on tape
So I can escape into the beat and make nuff papes
Word to god, kicking nuff freestyle rhymes",5
"One two, one two y'all
One two, check it out
Got my man CL
Can't forget my man, Cee-Lo
Can't forget money earnin', Mount Vernon
Can't forget New Roch'
Can't forget Westchester
Can't forget umm CL, hit me off

Feel the funk by the rap czars in sports cars
Comin atcha now you listen at the feet of a master
Caution, not Wheel of Fortune, here's a portion
Of untamedness, approachin famous, for miscellaneous
The track get crackin though, unexplainable
When I ground a jewel, sound is simply uncontainable
Release my soul, but never make the mistake
And play me like a stone cold fruitcake man
Cause you can never fathom G the dough we want so
My flow's the steadiest, to never leave us penniless
Come on down to the very necessary legendary
Well the more the merry stickin women type of villian
The evidence relentless, I ride to see you magnatized
Mecca to begin you're locked in no doubt
The label better push this, so we can pay the rent
You can season the pot well, but here's The Main Ingredient

The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient
Yo, The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient
Yo, The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient
The Main Ingredient y'all
Yo, The Main Ingredient, kick it CL

I know you wonder what kind of way is that to think:
Put all the wackest rappers on a boat and let it sink
Don't blink; next thing you see you spot is taken
No Jax I'm Fakin' soldiers took the whole reservation
On a scale of one to ten, we move rather swiftly
Want a dimepiece but we'll settle for an eight-fifty
Don't blow mine, your trump card is exposed to pages
Now your beginning's already at the final stages
Pumpin like 12 gauges from a shotgun blast
I never saw people run so fast, aight?
Stay up all night, then sleep all day
Makin big Lucci and would have it no other way
In conjunction, with the function, as stated
Orchestrated by the Soul Brother nickel plated
Tell the judge you were foolish, and try to be lenient
Cause you never had the The Main Ingredient

The Main Ingredient
Hit the third verse off kid

This cap is peeled layin joints like a minefield
When dynamite's my rhythm this is East coast terrorism
The Vernon-ville's Mecca Don, formin Voltron tactics
Let off three verses and the crowd panics
Get em all, the kingpin of the Player's Ball
Now every tramp in your camp's going AWOL
My Lucci situation is A Daily Operation
On the strip, I refine you like Tales From the Crypt
Right here's the real shit, and all that other's counterfeit
Funk to let you know exactly what you're dealin with
P-R slash, C-L smash, love to spend cash
For proper livin, slidin up in wealthy women
Stick your hand in my pants, and grab the mic's no crime
Cause like Sisters With Voices, it's about time
For you to respect my whole foundation precisely
Be obedient, to The Main Ingredient

Yo, The Main Ingredient
The Main Ingredient
Yo, The Main Ingredient
The Main Ingredient
Check out the funk y'all
Mic Check, one two
CL Smooth, and Pete Rock
Comin back, for ninety-four
Can't forget
Get on, to get on
It's time to get on, peace to I-n-I
Yeah, can't forget Baby Pah
Can't forget the whole roster
One two
Check it
It's The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient y'all
The Main Ingredient, y'all
The Main Ingredient, bust it",6
"You're everything that I dream about, talk about
Walk around and brag about, cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say, or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your loving, but hey
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're making me nervous, I don't deserve this, I'm Swayze
I wish I could be but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm telling you how I feel, shit is real
Now I don't really want to play myself so I say to myself:
""Self get a grip and don't slip""
Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from out of town
I get down, I've been around, I ain't no hand-me-down
So you gotta show respect for me if you're checking for me
And don't sweat me cause I really don't want no sweat on me
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stayed dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar can I get a sip?
Well maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal, what's the haps, where we at now?
Keeping it strong, moving it along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexing you
And I'll be swimming in some trim with a beachfront view
Cause all I wanna do is get next to you
Now leave your crew so we can step into my hideaway
So I can step into it right away
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Before you sit back and think I ain't saying nothing
You need to sit back and think about what I'm saying
Now relaying, my carmel flow
So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night I crack her open just like a lobster
(My CL Smooth) It's all good baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from making lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?",6
"Open Sesame, stepping through the mist, it's the specialist
Coming to box, and flooded with rocks
We'll get down for mine, the kind that makes cement feel us
Standing in the company of killers
Follow my trail as I walk through the valley of death
Left, to fear no evil, cause what I grip is legal
I'm hot like yard, the point guard of this group, on the loop
Never your right, raising all your game type tonight
Entering the level of high gear
You'd think it took a Bob Marley spliff to get here
Front to rear God of the drugs that you're hearing
While my neighbors say we need to be jailed for rackateering
Now appearing, Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the jugular
Now you got Mecca and the Soul Brother
Slightly, you might raise a hair of doubt
But if we don't rock the spot, The Sun Won't Come Out

Check it out, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You know we can't Reminisce
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

Un-chained heat, I hustle on the street or beat
To keep you on the edge of your seat, you consumer
A QB-like Boomer, the ultimate team
But if I wake up in another woman's bed, I'mma scream
I'm settin up shop pop to overthrow Castro
Chokin over Noriega's Garcia Vegas
Guess who supplies the pies and dope triples
Now she leaks ass cheeks, pearly whites and titty nipples
Would CL ever trick loot on PC?
Even if I never had sonny boy I disagree
Cut the small talk, I give more marks than a school of sharks
On attack, so keep your ass back
When it's wack you get a thumbs down, another record deal wasted
Listen man, find another occupation man
Here's the persuasion, blazin one amazin route that's all about
The Sun Won't Come Out

Yo, so check it out, with Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You can't Reminisce to T.R.O.Y
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

I rule chicks off acoustics, watchin the Knicks
We up ten, but need to stop shootin bricks
Put the jailhouse funk in under stars
Til the lines on my looseleaf, look like some metal bars
My forecast hits a megablast, and what I invent
A pack of bloodhounds could never get the scent
Payin off the beast now my bills increase
If there's a five dollar rock sold in the park I want a piece
The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness
Cause any verse rips a total eclipse for sun rays
Anyways was the phrase back in my younger days (so check it out)
Now the God displays the attribute, dealin with heat
From the bassment, enterin the streets you meet
Pete Rock and CL Smooth and when you see what it's about
You know The Sun Came Out, now pass my shades

Yo, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
We can't Reminisce
Yo, if we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Ghettoes of the Mind
If you know what I'm talking about
You know The Sun Won't Come Out, so check it

One two, Pete Rock and CL Smooth for ninety-four
Breakin you off somethin proper
Check it, peace y'all",6
"Check it out 
Ahh yeah 
Back again with another hit smash 
Pete Rock and CL Smooth 

We got the groove for you 
So go call your crew 
And let em know we in the house 
CL hit em off with the verses 

Never judge a book by the cover; discover the Soul Brother 
With the Mecca Don Workin' brunette to blonde 
How many Edison Con when I respond in full black 
with us havin' the Vernon Villians back to back 

Amazing grace when I face the great paperchase 
For real it's long overdue, so I don't want to talk to you 
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted 
every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted 

I'm livin through my son so daddy see it this way 
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA 
No doubt I with a 'piece, down in Mecca, all crazy 
to the lady, none of this is make-believe 

I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century 
Battle physically, conquer mentally 
Essentially, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, why'know, I'll take you there 

[Chorus]
C... L... what you gonna do 
You... know... you can make me Boo 
Over... and over again 
Come on, and take me there 

Control now so in the future see me callin' the shots 
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics 
I'm blowin' up spots for knots in the millennium years 
And now I drop it on my peers, brings Tears and Fears 

And now the question manifest in my only 
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue 
That brings a world of intrigue and glamor to my arsenal 
of Gods, pimps to players and layers of Deceptions 

My whole mindstate gravitate to weapon 
Makin people in the business get a misconception 
It ain't hard to the core, it ain't Sex on the Beach 
It's just another plateau the brothers have to reach 

Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided 
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided 
No question, you're dealing with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there 

[Chorus]

Set it so I can make em all respect my fame 
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game 
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay 
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away 

Chose for Negroes, the most hypnotical flows 
on the planet, another East coast track rose, God dammit 
My theme, to mainstream's the knocker 
Only time I get right as block is when my lucci's on lock 

Pretty much I'm comin through in the clutch see 
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel 
Or is it just my style of hustle makin a mark 
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park 

It was dark, when I brought it to the light, despite 
my staff's got me takin nothin but champagne baths 
Now the aftermath's dealin with a Mecca affair 
So anywhere you want to go, I'll take you there 

[Chorus] 

Just come on 
Take me right where I want to be 
Come on 
Come on to you and me 

Come on 
Ohhh 

Keep doin' it baby 
Check it out, bust it 

[Chorus: x2]",6
"Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

There she lays, never the nonsense
The mood to watch her focus on and
Slide so she can ride the man who's born to be sextified
Study my flicks if only chicks knew the mix for better brands
When power lands the sister had other plans
The plot is set for her to wed giver her dad's permission
To marry the next boss in line in his position
Overprotective, the objective is never to leave her
Taking street, who pack the heat, now meet the Black Caesar
Bought her diamonds and furs, silky jammies isn't hers
But deep down I think a simple man she prefers
Every kiss was a death wish, every plan was a let down
Stopping in tears she pulls over by the playground
Clearing her vision, spots a game through the schoolyard fence
Sneakers squeeking, ball bouncing, looking so intense
And since her hobby was photography with nothing to do
Cool, she takes a flick or two

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

A couple of weeks go by, clocking the boys around the town
Her mommy shopping, daddy dealing, leaving night all time around
For her to execute her a level to break the family ties
To gamble her future on the love, murder, money, and lies
Watch out, the woman's about to love and claim her king
So she drove up in the ghetto looking to do her thing
Checking the brothers going crazy when the car skirts by the flow
I keep it real and peep it all from my window
So please, the lady's heading upstairs the first door
The second deliver my clothes, the third, run my tub water
Every way she represented made sense to me
When black is out of state, building spots, making lucci
The wind blows the candles, now the moon shines on my chest
But nevertheless I gently rest my head on her breast
But danger lurks in the wings based on how the cards read 'em
I think she'd better tell 'em

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

The blackest of the seeds to dawn stepping with two briefcases
Son you bless your people when you conquer like Hannibal
When I was about your age, I ran the numbers for money
I'm picturing him and John Gotti hanging in the study
I grew to be large in Crooklyn with your daddy back in the day
We were ready to take Harlem before he passed away
Women and booze, the weapon I choose then was truly major
I'm ringside with Don King when Ali fought Frazier
Scars and metals, when the mob settles I was flexing
My daughter was born so I called the X for some direction
Your father's words are like the Bible to black
But beware, he came barging in your room and you wasn't there
You let your mind wander, taste and face the search party
Left the grounds fully loaded with the tre pound
Then come in deep on the creep to find you and me
Cause you can't stop destiny

Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real",5
"Who keeps it methods and orthodox, who caught the props
Who's styles are shit, who's gonna rock?
On to the break of dawn, you wanna battle, pay the price
Mathematically precise, smooth and plus nice
With a flow that's like a mailman or letter carrier
Rob-O brings the ghetto area
Funk flavor through your neighborhood, state, town, or borough
Stay down, I don't think I'm quite thorough
Not your average rapper (Listen)
Cause in a sec I write some shit to blast your wack ass to Mecca
See Rob's the most Mecca
To grab the microphone and yes y'all it
To school these dreds and stress these bald heads
The INI's in the house (You don't stop)
Pete Rock, Grap Luva, Mark, and Polo rising and you don't stop
We let the funk slide and let God be our guide
Flowing from the Vernon worldwide

It's the funk god, taking you worldwide, so bust it
Flowing over beats cause it's a must, kid
That I proceed to fix the hardcore in the mix
Check one two with the flow that fits
I make the hits that soar, I put the wreck in the raw
'94 in your local record store
It's Pete Rock and CL, the Main Ingredient
Now leave your wack style home, cause you won't be needing it
I grab the mic and get wreck for real
You hear me on the wax, kid, you see me on the steel
Can you feel the funk as I inject?
Then God protect it, hold the mic, see I select it
To keep it crazy versatile
But still underground, packs the four pound cause it's wild
In this place you'll find it hard to hide
Soul Brother and I'm going worldwide

Now who's the greatest? Few debate this, you're still figuring?
Well perish the thought, there's none bigger in
This act son, Mecca is all I attract
You're wack, son, yeah your talent's a fraction
While I'm nice, as Christ, there's two religions
So envision a messiah on a mission, the competition
I'll stop your wishing point blank cause you lost it
Your joint sank, your soft style's exhausted
And now it's mandatory, you stand before me amazed and awed
Giving praise, you're the God
Rob cipher's born, most Mecca supreme
A fly MC with the self-esteem
You keep it wholesome and still I relax a bit
I play your shit out like ??? cause my wig out has to hit
I'm steadily encouraging head bops while you're scurrying to get props
I'm worldwide

Yo, check out the rhyme buster, pulling niggas through the wringer
I'm not a singer, as I conduct with one finger
It's the orchestrater, mutilator, master funktator
I've got mad flow from here to Asia
Cause I'll amaze ya with the skills that I possess
Not categorized with all the rest
So I suggest if you're in the way step aside
Cause Pete Rock is coming worldwide",5
"What's going on baby?
Ain't nutting - it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live
Let's get right to it

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

Feel the vibe, when it's bumping in my tribe, steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doing trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, living well
And never cease to flip the hottest dimepiece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slipping off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

You want a slow wind under my ceiling fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rocking you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasing hits, taking love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop faking me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dimepieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinking totally nude with no limits
Going through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showing nothing but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doing them things, listen

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up",6
"One evening as the sun went down
And the jungle fires were burning,
Down the track came a hobo hiking,
And he said, ""Boys, I'm not turning
I'm headed for a land that's far away
Besides the crystal fountains
So come with me, we'll go and see
The Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
There's a land that's fair and bright,
Where the handouts grow on bushes
And you sleep out every night.
Where the boxcars all are empty
And the sun shines every day
And the birds and the bees
And the cigarette trees
The lemonade springs
Where the bluebird sings
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
All the cops have wooden legs
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs
The farmers' trees are full of fruit
And the barns are full of hay
Oh I'm bound to go
Where there ain't no snow
Where the rain don't fall
The winds don't blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never change your socks
And the little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks
The brakemen have to tip their hats
And the railway bulls are blind
There's a lake of stew
And of whiskey too
You can paddle all around it
In a big canoe
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains,
The jails are made of tin.
And you can walk right out again,
As soon as you are in.
There ain't no short-handled shovels,
No axes, saws nor picks,
I'm bound to stay
Where you sleep all day,
Where they hung the jerk
That invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains.",5

That Reno hill
He blew at the crossing
With an awful shrill
The switchman knew
By the engines moan
That the man at the throttle
Was Casey Jones
Casey got to that certain place
Old Number Nine
Stared him straight in the face
He said to the fireman
Boy, you'd better jump
Cause there are 2 locomotives
And they're bound to bump

Two locomotives

On the Salt Lake Line

He had many a mile to go that night
Before he reached the town-o, town-o town-o,
Many a mile to go that night before he reached the town

Where the ducks and the geese were kept there in
Said a couple of you gonna grease my chin
Before I leave this town o, town o, town o
Couple of you gonna grease my chin before I leave this town
Couple of you gonna grease my chin before I leave this town

Throwed a duck across his back

"Now Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts
Oh Lord, how they did love
Swore to be true to each other true as the stars above
He was her man but he wouldn't do her wrong.

Now Frankie went down to the corner
Just for a bucket of beer
She said Mr Bartender has my loving Johnny been here
He's my man, he wouldn't do me wrong.

I don't want to cause you no trouble
Woman, I ain't gonna lie
But I saw your lover an hour ago
With a girl named Nellie Blie
He's your man but he's doin' you wrong.

Now Frankie looked over the transom
She saw to her surprise
There on the cab sat Johnny
Making love to Nellie Blie
He's my man, but he's doin' me wrong.

Frankie threw back her comona
Took out her little 44
Rutty too-too three times she shot right through
That hardwood door
Shot her man, he was doin' her wro

Now bring out your rubber tired hearses
Bring out your rubber tired hack
I'm taken said the man to the graveyard
But only six of 'em called him back
He was my man but he done me wrong.

Bring round a thousand policemen
Bring 'em around today
To lock me down in that dungeon cell
And throw that key away
I shot my man, he was doin' me wrong.

Now Frankie she said to the warden
What are they goin' to do
The warden he said to Frankie
It's the electric chair for you
You shot your man, he was doin' you wrong.

This story has no end
This story just goes to show

Oh Lord, what a beauty

"My mother called me to her bedside
These words she said to me
If you don't quit your rambling ways
They're gonna get you in the penitentiary
Gonna get you in the penitentiary poor boy
Gonna get you in the penitentiary
If you don't quit your reckless ways
They're gonna get you in the penitentiary

So I sat myself down in a gambling game
But I could not play my hand
Just thinking about that woman I love
Run away with another man
Run away with another man poor boy
Run away with another man
Just thinking about that woman I love
Run away with another man

The cards came around the table lord
And I had such a worried mind
My stack of gold dollars I wasted away
And I lost about ninety-nine
I lost about ninety-nine poor boy
I lost about ninety-nine
My stack of gold dollars I wasted away
And I lost about ninety-nine

It wasn't very long till I seen him again
He ran away left her behind
And I laid him down with my old forty-four
And the judge gave me ninety-nine
The judge gave me ninety-nine poor boy
The judge gave me ninety-nine 
I laid a man down with my big forty-four
And the judge gave me ninety-nine

Well the jury said I had to pay
And the clerk he wrote it down
And the judge called out my number
Two sixes upside down
Two sixes upside down poor boy
Two sixes upside down
The judge called out my number
Two sixes upside down",4

"I had a little book was given to me,
And every page spelled Liberty.
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

If religion were a thing that money could buy,
The rich would live and the poor would die.
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

Too late my brothers, too late, but never mind.
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

There is a tree in Paradise
The Pilgrims call it ""The Tree Of Life""
All my trials Lord, soon be over.

Too late my brothers, too late, but never mind.

"I asked my love to take a walk
Just a little ways with me
And as we walked and we would talk
All about our wedding day

[Chorus]
And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

[Chorus]

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried ""Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity.""

I took her by her golden curls
I drug her down to the river-side
An I there threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

[Chorus]

And going home between twelve and one
I cried ""Lord, what have I've done?""
I've killed the girl I love
Because she would not marry me

"I was down the glen one Easter morn
To a city fair rode I.
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons passed me by.
No pipe did hum, no battle drum did sound it's loud tattoo.
But the Angelus Bells o'er the Liffey swells rang out in the foggy dew.
Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war.
'Twas better to die 'neath that Irish sky
Than at Sulva or Sud el Bar.
And from the plains of Royal Meath
Strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew.
Their bravest fell and the requiem bell
Rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Eastertide in the
Springing of the year.
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few.
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew.
And back through the glen
I rode again.
And my heart with grief was sore.
For I parted then with valiant men
Whom I never shall see n'more.
But to and fro in my dreams I go
And I kneel and pray for you.
For slavery fled the glorious dead
When you fell in the foggy dew.",6
"In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
She was a fishmonger and sure it was no wonder
For so were her father and mother before
And they both wheeled their barrows through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
She died of a fever and no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow through streets broad and narrow
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!
A-live a-live O! A-live a-live O!
Crying cockles and mussels alive a-live O!",5
"It happened an hour ago,
Way down in this tunnel of coal,
Gas caught fire from somebody's lamp.
And the miners are choking in smoke.

Goodbye to Dickie and Honey,
Goodbye to the wife that I love.
Lot of these men not coming home,
Tonight when the work whistle blows.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

It looks like the end for me,
And all of my buddies I see.
We're all writing letters to children we love,
Please carry our word to our wives.

We, found a little place in the air,
Crawled and drug ourselves here.
But the smoke is bad and the fumes coming in,
And the gas is burning my eyes.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

Forgive me for the things I done wrong,
I love you lots more than you know.
When the night whistle blows and I don't come home,
Do all that you can to help mom.

I can hear the moans and groans,
More than a hundred good men.
Just work and fight and try to see,
That this never happens again.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.

My eyes are blinded with fumes,
But it sounds like the men are all gone,
'Cept Joe Valentini, Fred Gussler and George,
Trapped down in this hell hole of fire.

Please name our new baby Joe,
So he'll grow up like big Joe.
He'll work and he'll fight and he'll fix up the mines,
So fire can't kill daddy no more.

Dear sisters and brothers goodbye,
Dear mother and father goodbye.
My fingers are weak and I cannot write,
Goodbye Centralia, goodbye.",5
"Farethee well Old Joe Clark
Farethee well I say
Farethe well Old Joe Clark
I'm bound go go away
I will not go to Old Joe's house
I'll tell ya the reason why
Every floor in Old Joes's house
Is filled with chicken pie
Old Joe Clark he did take sick
And what do ya think ailed him?
He drank a churn of butter milk
And then his stomach failed him
I will not marry an old maid
And I'll tell ya the reason why
Her neck's so long and stringy boys
I'm afraid she'll never die
Old Joe Clark he did get drunk
And he sat down to his supper
He leaned over at the dinner table
And stoved his nose in the butter",4
"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",5
"Ira Hayes,
Ira Hayes

[Chorus]
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the land of the Pima Indian
A proud and noble band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land

Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped

Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed

[Chorus]

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to walk back down again

And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

[Chorus]

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored; Everybody shook his hand

But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

[Chorus]

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;
Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
Like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

[Chorus]

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes
But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died",5
"Be kind to your parents
Though they don't deserve it
Remember that grown ups
Is a difficult stage of life

They're apt to be nervous
And over excited
Confused by their
Daily storm and strife

Just keep in mind
Though it seems hard I know
Most parents were children long ago

Incredible
So treat them with patience
And kind understanding
In spite of the foolish things they do

Some day you might wake up
And find you're a parent too",6
"There was once a farmer, walking down the road whistling a tune to himself. 
He said, ""Dog-gone, I wish I had some words to that tune. 
But all I've got is the melody."" Just then he came to a little bridge, 
And he leaned on the railing looking down at the brook. 
There was a big old bullfrog, hopping from bank to bank. 

Well, the bullfrog looked up and saw the farmer and decided to show off. 
He took an extra special big hop - z-z-z-z-tt! 
He landed, splash! in the water and got himself all wet. 
The farmer laughed and laughed and started singing
""Way down south in the yankety-yank, a bull frog jumped from bank to bank, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do! 
He stubbed his toe and fell in the water,
You could hear him yell for a mile and a quarter, 
Just because he'd nothing better for to do.""

Now the farmer went walking down the road 
Feeling mighty proud of himself for making up a song. 
He went down to the corner store, bought himself some groceries, 
A pair of work gloves and a plug of chewing tobacco, and said, 
""Oh, before I go, I have to sing you my new song.""

""Go on home,"" says the storekeeper, 
""I'm busy here, can't you see all these customers?""

""I won't pay you any money unless you let me sing you my song!""

""Well, sing it and get it over with then,"" 
Said the storekeeper.

The farmer began to sing and the man in the store cried out, 
""That's a w-o-o-nderful song, gather round everybody, 
We'll have a party."" And he passed round the free Coca Colas 
And the free soda-crackers, and everyone was stamping on the floor.

Meanwhile, all the wives and children back home 
Were sitting down to supper, and, where's father?

The mother said, 
""Children, you better run down to the corner store and fetch your old man. 
He's probably down there wasting his time as usual.""

So all the children run down the road. 
They run inside the corner store. 
You know, they heard all that music, 
They forgot about coming home. 
The children started singing 

And they were passing around the free Coca-Colas and 

Now, in every farmhouse it was the same situation. 
The mother said to themselves, ""This has gone far enough. 
Supper's getting cold. 'Spect us to work all the day nobody show up?""

They reached over on the stove 
And grabbed some heavy frying pans 
And start down the road with a mad look in their eyes. 
Somebody's going to get beaned.

Well, they get near and they hear all that pretty music, 
And they forget all about being mad. 
They drop the frying pans in the gutter, 
Walk into the store, and the mothers start singing! 
Way down yonder in the yankety-yank, 
A bullfrog jumped from bank to bank 
And they're passing round the free Coca-Colas 
And the free soda crackers, 
And everybody is stamping on the floor!

Meanwhile out in the barns all the cows started talking, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be milked and it's getting mighty uncomfortable!"" 
So the cows left their stalls, they wobbled out of the barn, 
And down the road right into the corner store. 
And the cows started singing, 
""Moo, moo, moo, moo, moo moo, moo, moo, moo, moo."" 

And the cow's tails were swishing out the windows, 
And they were stamping on the floor,
And drinking the free Coca-Colas and eating the free soda 

Out in the barnyard all the chickens said, 
""Where is everybody? We're supposed to be fed and we're getting hungry!"" 
So the chickens hopped over the fence, 
Hopped down the road, hopped into the store, 
And the chickens started; (Chicken imitation to tune). 
And the chicken were stamping on the floor and drinking the free Coca C 

Meanwhile all the barns started talking to each other. 
""We feel mighty lonely,"" they said, ""without any cows or any chickens. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
So the barns picked themselves off their foundations and galumphed down the road, 
And s-q-u-e-e-z-e-d themselves into that corner store, 
Believe it or not. Did you ever hear a rusty hinge on a barn door? 
That's the way the barns sang

Out in the fields all the grass says, 
""Where is everybody? The cows are supposed to come and eat us. 
I guess we'll have to go find them."" 
And the grass picked itself up and swished off down the road, 
And swished right into the store and started singing

Of course, when the grass was gone, the fields were gone, 
So the brook didn't have any banks to flow between. 
It said, ""I've got to go someplace,"" 
So it bubbled down the road. 
It bubbled right up into the corner store and the brook started
Bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl-bubbl.

The brook was bubbling up and down the stairway! 
The grass was growing out the chimney! 
Feathers flying through the air! 
Cows tails swishing through the windows! 
Everybody stamping on the floor 
And drinking the free Coca-Cola 
And eating the free soda-crackers!

Meanwhile, there's the bullfrog in mid-air!

He looks down, there's nothing underneath him. 
He looks over and there's no bank to land on. 
He says, ""Where am I?""
And he starts hopping down the road. 
Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop! Hop!

""Hey, what's all that racket down at the corner store?"" says the frog.

""Why 
They're singing! 
They're singing about ME!"" 
And he was so proud he puffed himself up with pride.

And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he puffed, 
And he boom!

He exploded. 
Cows, barns, chickens, farmers, the whole corner store went up in the air, 
And everybody floated down 
And landed right where they were supposed to have been all the time. 
They all sat down eating supper again, 
Feeling kind of foolish for themselves.

Next day they went out to find the frog. 
They looked high, they looked low. 
Coca-Cola bottles and soda crackers in all directions. 
But no frog.

So all there is left of the frog is the song. 
We might as well sing 'er once again.

""Way down yonder in the yankety-yank""",5

"On the streets of New York city when the hour was getting late
Young men armed with knives and guns, young men armed with hate
And Lou Marsh stepped between them and died there in his tracks
For one man is no army when the city turns its back

Now the streets are empty, now the streets are dark
So keep an eye on shadows and never pass the park
For the city is a jungle when the law is out of sight
Death lurks in El Barrio with the orphans of the night

He left behind a chamber of a church he served so long
For he learned the prayers of distant men will never right the wrongs
His church became an alley and his pulpit was the street
He made his congregation from the boys he used to meet

There were two gangs approaching in spanish Harlem town
The smell of blood was in the air, the challenge was laid down
He felt their blinding hatred, and he tried to save their lives
And the answer that they gave him was their fists and feet and knives

Will Lou Marsh lie forgotten in his cold and silent grave?
Will his memory still linger on, in those he tried to save?
All of us who knew him will now and then recall
And shed a tear on poverty, tombstone of us all",4
"Walking down death row,
I sang for three men destined for the chair;
Walking down death row,
I sang of lives and loves in other years.
Walking down death row, I sang of hopes that used to be.
Through the bars, into each separate cell,
Yes, I sang to one and two and three.
""If you'd only only stuck together you'd not be sitting here!
""If you could have loved each other's lives, you'd not be sitting here!
""And if only this you could believe,
""You might still, you might still be reprieved.""

Walking down death row,
I turned the corner and found to my surprise;
There were women there as well,
With babies in their arms, before my eyes.
Walking down death row,
I tried once more to sing of hopes that used to be.
But the thought of that contraption, down the hall,
Waiting for whole families, one dozen, two or three,
""If you'd only stuck together, you'd not be here!
""If you could've loved another's child as well as your own, you'd not be sitting here!
""And if only this you could believe,
""You might still, you might still be reprieved.""

Walking down death row,
I concentrated, singing to the young.
I sang of hopes that flickered still,
I tried to mouth their many separate tongues.
Walking down death row,
I sang of life and love that still might be.
Singing down death row,
To each separate human cell, One billion, two, or three,
""If we'd only stick together, we'd not be here!
""If we could learn to love each other's lives, we'd not be sitting here!
""And if only this we could believe,
""We still might, we still might be reprieved.""",5

"Sailing down my dirty stream
Still I love it and I'll keep the dream
That some day, though maybe not this year
My Hudson River will once again run clear

It starts high in the mountains of the north
Crystal clear and icy trickles forth
With just a few floating wrappers of chewing gum
Dropped by some hikers to warn of things to come

At Glens Falls, five thousand honest hands
Work at the consolidated paper plant
Five million gallons of waste a day
Why should we do it any other way?

Down the valley one million toilet chains
Find my Hudson so convenient place to drain
And each little city says, ""Who, me?
Do you think that sewage plants come free?""

Out in the ocean they say the water's clear
But I live right at Beacon here
Half way between the mountains and sea
Tacking to and fro, this thought returns to me

Well it's Sailing up my dirty stream
Still I love it and I'll dream
That some day, though maybe not this year
My Hudson and my country will run clear",5
"Come fill up your glasses and set yourselves down.
I'll tell you a story of somebody's town.
It isn't too near and it's not far away.
It's not a place where I'd want to stay.

[Chorus:]
Now the people are scratching all over the street
Because the rabbits had nothing to eat.

The winter came in with a cold icy blast.
It killed off the flowers and killed off the grass.
The rabbits were starving because of the freeze.
They started eating the bark off the trees.

[Chorus]

The farmers said, ""This sort of thing just won't do.
Our trees will be dead when the rabbits get through.
We'll have to poison the rabbits, it's clear;
Or we'll have no crops to harvest next year.""

[Chorus]

So they brought the poison and spread it around.
And soon dead rabbits began to be found.
Dogs ate the rabbits and the farmers just said,
""We'll poison those rabbits 'til the last dog is dead.""

[Chorus]

Up in the sky there were meat-eating fowls.
The dead rabbits poisoned the hawks and the owls.
Thousands of field mice the hawks used to chase
Were multiplying all over the place.

[Chorus]

The fields and the meadows were barren and brown.
The mice got hungry and moved into town.
The city folks took the farmer's advise
And all of them started to poison the mice.

[Chorus]

There were dead mice in all the apartments and flats.
The cats ate the mice and the mice killed the cats.
The smell was awful and I'm glad to say
I wasn't the man hired to haul them away.

[Chorus]

All through the country and all through the town
There wasn't a dog or cat to be found.
The fleas asked each other, ""Where can we stay?""
They've been on the people from then 'til this day.

[Chorus]

All you small creatures that live in this land
Stay clear of the man with the poisonous hand!
A few bails of hay might keep you alive
But he'll pay more to kill you than let you survive.

"Come and take a walk with me through this green and growing land
Walk through the meadows and the mountains and the sand
Walk through the valleys and the rivers and the plains
Walk through the sun and walk through the rain

Here is a land full of power and glory
Beauty that words cannot recall
Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom
Her glory shall rest on us all (on us all)

From Colorado, Kansas, and the Carolina's too
Virginia and Alaska, from the old to the new
Texas and Ohio and the California shore
Tell me, who could ask for more?

Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor
Only as free as the padlocked prison door
Only as strong as our love for this land
Only as tall as we stand

But our land is still troubled by men who have to hate
They twist away our freedom & they twist away our fate
Fear is their weapon and treason is their cry
We can stop them if we try",5
"Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they're gone

If I'd known before I courted
I never would've courted none
I'd a lock my heart in a box of golden
And fastened it up with silver pin

I wish I were some little sparrow
And I had wings and I could fly
I'd fly away to my false true lover
And when he'd speak, I would deny

But I am not some little swallow
I have no wings, neither can I fly
So I will sit down here to weep in sorrow
And try to pass my troubles by

Oh don't you remember our days of courting
When your head lay upon my breast
You could make me believe by the falling of your arm
That the sun rose in the west

Come all ye fair and tender ladies
Take warning how you court your men
They're like a star on a summer morning
They first appear and then they're gone",7
